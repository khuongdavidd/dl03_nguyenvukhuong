0,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",David J,"Apr 20, 2019","Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.  The final assignment has a 300+ reply thread in the discussion forum because you are graded on the ability to integrate your IBM Watson Notebook with IBM cloud storage, but the instructions have multiple errors, such as not working if you provision your storage in the wrong region.
This class is a shameless excuse for making you sign up for products you don't want, and then grading you on your ability to use them, not your ability to write python code.",1
1,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Ruben F,"Nov 26, 2018","Still I don't understand the relation of the course' content and the final assignment. 
In addition, I would like to see how should have been done the final assignment, i.e an example corrected and done correctly.
this is the 4th course and still I can't understand anything of python. I haven't learn anything... my money is going to the waste. 
IBM says that you don't need previous knowledge of python or programming...that is a lie. I am biochemist and I have a MSc in One health, and during mi years we had lessons of R and R deducer. During that lessons, the materials given by the professors were clear and easy to follow. But this course has been awful..... I am feel like if I were an idiot but I know for sure that  I am not. The problem is this rubbish course. ",1
2,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Jiayang Z,"Feb 12, 2019","The worst course I took. I couldn't believe the course is provided by IBM. The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
3,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1
4,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Robert I,"May 10, 2019","I had a lot of problems with the Peer Assignment, which had nothing to do with Python Programming. The Watson environment has changed a lot compared to the learning materials.

6,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

but,
(0 stars):  Instructions for IBM Watson and how to setup the assignments are outdated/incorrect.  It took me less time to finish the course, and a lot more time just to figure out how to setup Watson based on the instructions (website & course material do not match).  This is something that IBM can greatly improve without a lot of effort, imho.
The final assignment was an exercise in Watson, and barely on the course material :-(",1
8,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Declan H M G,"May 22, 2019","The course content is good. However, the instructions for the final peer graded assignment are unclear.

I'm familiar with Python but I still had to go back and review them a few times. Would prefer the video materials to be reviewed more slowly and deliberately.
The final project is a mess. The instructions don't direct to the correct notebook (U.S. GDP data) and that link has to be found from the forums. I could never figure out how to get the JSON credential data of my IBM Watson ""bucket"", so, my ""dashboard"" never got generated for my project.

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

It just starts with the basic and focuses on data structures which is essential for Data Science.

26,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Jakub M,"Feb 14, 2020","I am sorry but this is simply terrible.
I thought that Data Camp courses could use some work but after this mess - I am gladly returning to them. Save yourself some money and buy a decent book or watch videos on YouTube.
My complaints:
1) The final assignment doesn't load - I would probably force myself to finish this whole certificate, but I am not able to load the final assignment. Many other people have the same issue. What the hell is this?
2) Videos are very low quality - badly edited PowerPoint presentations read by a robot lady voice. No good examples, no engaging elements.
3) Quizzes are a joke - I can bet anyone 5$ that you will be able to pass most of them without watching a single video.
4) IBM tools overall - you use Jupyter notebooks here through some IBM site. Terribly complicated to set up, loads a while, and notebooks are not very high quality (compared for example with Data Camp). Why not encourage the user to download some Python IDE on their desktop and write the code by themselves?
Lesson learned: choose universities, not companies on Coursera. Not taking further courses in this certificate. Spend this money on a book, do some simple projects and put them on a GitHub account - this will be worth 10x more as this joke of a certificate. 
(First course is worth taking for sure - enjoyable, high quality)",1
27,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Keynon K,"Mar 9, 2021","The course goes from informational video, to a lab explaining the exact same information as the video, then an impossible exercise within the lab comprised of information that was not covered in any of the previous sections, and then a quiz containing material covered.
With the current flow of the course one is able to retain the theories discussed but absolutely cannot generate the code from scratch if asked to.
I have completed the entire Introduction to Data Science Specialization, which did a terrific job of compounding information on top of each other, building up to the final assessment that you've now been prepared for. I was extremely disappointed that this course was not as well put as the first program. I am now skeptical about the remaining courses in the Certification programs I plan on pursuing.",2

30,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Rebecca H,"Mar 1, 2021","Quite honestly, I am frustrated with this course. The material was generally good, but the content often had typos, odd phrasing, etc. which just made it more challenging on top of learning this new language. I also found the course exercises (particularly weeks 3 & 4) were not at the ""beginner"" level--I was able to pass quizzes and and do the assignments just fine, but the exercises would always come out of left field, pulling from concepts I hadn't yet learned. I ended up doing a lot of researching outside of the course content on my own, which I'm not opposed to, but that is certainly not how they marketed it and made me feel like there was something wrong with the way I was learning, when it was really the way that they were teaching the material. I was grateful for the course discussion board, where a lot of people expressed similar frustrations and it made me realize I am not alone in this and often gave me good resources to review.  ",2
31,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",R D,"Mar 22, 2023","I recently completed this Python training course hoping to gain a strong foundation in Python coding as needed for the IBM Data Science certificate. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the quality of the course and found myself having to rely on other resources in order to understand the concepts, pass the course and gain credit.
The main issue I encountered was the poor quality of the instruction videos, which are crudely produced (think awful PowerPoint graphics) and lacked sufficient explanations, in fact, the labs just duplicate the videos but have slightly better explanations. The poor video quality made it difficult to understand what was being said, and the videos did not cover all the necessary aspects of Python coding, leaving me feeling ill-prepared to apply the concepts in real-world situations.
Overall, I would not recommend this Python training course to anyone who is new to Python coding and seeking a comprehensive understanding of the language. The course was not worth the charges and I was left feeling disappointed.
In summary, I would advise those seeking to understand Python coding to look elsewhere for a more thorough and well-executed course.

The time estimates are way inflated. This course can be completed in 1 week. 
The final assignment is not at all challenging. The course makers provide the code that does the hard part.

It's a problem with all Python courses for beginners, on all platforms, it's not for complete beginners really, you need to have the basics of programming prior to that as the instructors in the videos and training materials operate with the terms  and concepts that are very hard to understand for non-programmers.  The weeks 3 and 4 are especially hard to understand as the complexity of the new terms gets sharply a lot harder to understand, and a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes also give an impression that the authors didn't really review the material before posting it.",2

Does not provide opportunities for meaningful practice. 
The instructions in the videos are often vague or misleading (especially with naming of variables) and there were several instances where I (an ""advanced beginner"", generously) had to de-bug the examples and instructions in the Labs to get them to work.
IBM was clearly sloppy when they put together this course, and that is reflected in the quality of the learning you'll obtain. Again, a fine generalist's overview but will not prepare you to use Python in a meaningful way.",3

43,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Jasmine H,"Sep 2, 2021","Instructor responses (and lack thereof) leave a lot to be desired - Seems like a lot of people have the same issue in week 5 that hasn't been addressed. This course also frequently presents code that accomplishes a task without explaining *why* the code accomplishes a task, and will introduce a term without explaining it (ie throwing ""parse engine"" into the mix with no explanation). Additionally, the lessons are very content-dense, but quizzes are both remarkably short and very far apart, meaning they cover very little information. The final exam contained no feedback regarding which answer is correct if you answer incorrectly, which is frustrating as it deprives you of a final learning experience. Overall I would not recommend this course and would recommend an in-person, or at least real-instructor-led, experience for this topic. ",2

45,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Hakki K,"Jul 9, 2020","Hi,
I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.

I'm a coding beginner. Had some classes in University about programming with C and Java but just learned basic concepts like what are functions. 
The course first gave me some really interesting insights. The Videos are super helpful and also the first two weeks of exercises were really helpful. 
But as I moved further, the exercises got super hard. At least for coding beginners. Personally from week 3 on it just felt like that they don'T really wanna teach you coding but just showing you how it's done. For example they show you how you can Webscrape or convert dictonairies to lists but you can't really code them by yourself. The most frequend command I executed was running the code already in the cells.

I got nothing out of this course until Week 4 when it had an interesting take on open(, pandas & NumPy.  The last 2 Weeks are good enough for me to go back over to make it so I can get the most out of the money the company I work for paid for this course.

So it would have been much easier for me to follow if there were clearer reference material rather than mainly videos. I learnt nearly exclusively off the pynb, but I noticed quite a few of the questions specifically asked about the videos. Secondly, more explanations as to why we are doing something, maybe make it more task oriented. i.e., We are looking for this, this is how you would go about finding it, etc. I didn't understand most of the time why I was performing a task or why this was shown to me. Lastly, it would have been much easier to follow if it would explain what every step, code, function etc was explained.

72,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Emily N,"Oct 29, 2020","The course is super frustrating, the robot voice for the videos makes it so difficult to digest the information, the cadence and focus on certain words is completely wrong, so it makes it so hard to understand, especially when introducing new terms. Given that a lot of the information is presented on slides its really tricky to read at your own pace with the correct intonations and also see the code on the video. It seems really lazy to not have a person with subject knowledge read the video material in a much more engaging way (as with all other Coursera courses I've tried) - this would make the material much easier to engage with and less like I've just installed a text to voice reader on a wikipedia page. 
I also think some more real life application based would make it much easier to engage with the material - when I've looked at other courses (e.g. Khan academy, codeacademy, they at least explain 'for loops can be applied for example in XXX'. The labs are good, but the videos have to be some of the least engaging videos on programming that I have ever come across!!
Also, Also, a lot of terms are introduced without any explanation as to their function. In the videos sometimes terms are just introduced on the screen e.g. '_init_ ' but with no explanation whatsoever as to what this means or when it's used. This is meant to be a beginner course and provide knowledge to apply in a workplace setting going forward, but I find myself constantly googling to get background information on Python code. As an example, I messaged my friend (who is teaches python in a university) who gave a brief explanation to 'init: ""Short for initialise. When you create an object of any type, you either create a real one or a default one. So for the circle example, a default circle could be the unit circle, but you (as a programmer) may want a 5 inch circle so you would use the class constructor to initialise / override the default values"" .
This kind of simple background explanations would go a long way to actually teaching people how to understand what the code is doing, and the background of it and why you use it, so that you are actually more capable of applying this in a future setting. It also helps make the course a lot more human, rather than trying to teach it in a way where you can only remember the code but not actually understand what any of it means or does! 
I'm really disappointed with this course, I hope the other IBM python courses are better!!",2
73,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Hani H,"Mar 16, 2022","It's funny how the last thing we learned about is beautiful soup, because that's exactly how I would describe the course , except for the beautiful part. It's ugly.
First of all the course lacks organization. You learn how to import CSVs in the begining of week four, and how to import JSON files at the end of week 5. Wouldnt it make more sense if the two topics were covered together? and no I did not need to know what a JSON file is before learning how to import it. It's enough to teach me how its structured.
And this philosophy is carried all over the course. It seems like IBM is confusing the forest for the trees. The module working with webscrapping had two vidoes explaining the communication between client and resource, and two other videos on web scrapping itself. IBM, listen to me, teach me practical skills, I can use beatuful soup without understanding how it works under the hood. Spend that time on things that actually matters. 
Okay fine, the course is a mess, but did I learn something useful? yes, but that's thanks to the many tutorials I read/watched on other websites. This course jumps from covering the absolute basics to flashing an advanced concepts and moving on. For example, we learned how to create a simple dataframes, but grouping and aggregation, the stuff that actually matters, was only flashed on the screen for 5 seconds in a video on APIs. How am I supposed to do analysis without learning about aggregation? Well thanks to youtube I can. If this course is useful for anything its to point you to the right direction. Self study is essential.
The lab sessions are borderline useless, 90% of the exercises are super basic and were covered in the lectures, but are these any example datasets to work on? is there a multi step analysis to complete? are there any problems that go beyond creating a smile 1 line of code? not really. That's up to you to do on your own. 
I'm comparing this course with the Google Analytics module on R, the difference is night and day. This is simply a low effort attempt. I expected better. ",2
74,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Mori H,"Jun 13, 2023","The first two modules where really good. very beginner friendly, but everything after that was way to advanced. I spend a lot of time each day on Coursera so i can learn and practice, but i was stuck on everything after module 2 for almost two weeks and it was so discouraging because i though i was the problem and just wasn't smart enough to learn Python. After looking at the discussion forum though, i realized i wasn't the only one confused and lost from how advanced everything got so quick. this defiantly needs to be looked into and made easier to understand and we need to be taught how to build and form the data correctly. so many new words and codes where introduced too soon when we didn't even understand what each part meant individually. Also, the labs need some work with the spelling and solutions. There where to many times where incorrect spelling in the solutions led me to errors and i would end up giving up on trying to figure out what should be there.  All in All it could have been better. I watch Bro Code on youtube and he teaches a lot of the material taught in this course but simple and beginner friendly so it is possible to simplify this course. ",2
75,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",John G,"Mar 10, 2021","I am a beginner in Python. This course covered a lot and I understand a lot more now. However, there were always steps and explanations missing. The labs were basically clear until some of the practice exercises which required a lot of things that were not included in the course. The labs in general, however, were very useful.
As many people wrote, there were so many mistakes in spelling and sometimes even in the code. Shame on IBM for not having someone proofread! Furthermore, this robotic woman never stops and never intonates when something changes on the slides. Presentations were so poor. Were they given to a student as homework to create? I don't have anything against Indians, but did the course really need to be outsourced to India to be created? I am sure that if IBM had run this course with its employees as a trial group, it never would have been released as it is. I'm sure that IBM would not offer this course to its employees. In any case, I am happy that I went through it, but am looking for other courses/resources to actually understand Python.",2
76,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Aneta R,"Nov 2, 2023","It wasn't a bad course, but I have some reservations.
1) I'm not sure about the beginner level. The beginning is nice and easy, but in the labs, there are some things that aren't explained at all and are just... there. An absolute beginner has no chance of knowing the purpose of the code, etc.
2) Someone should consider a revision because some things just don't work outside the Jupyter Notebook. Maybe this isn't a problem for many people, but when learning, I prefer to have the materials on my PC, and this wasn't entirely possible without the help of ChatGPT.
3) I wasn't able to download the cheat sheets as PDF, even though it was written that you can do it. I tried other browsers, but I just couldn't.
4) There were loads of typos and inconsistencies. I would expect more thorough work, especially when it's not just a course you have to pay for, but an IBM course.",2

Forum posts dating back to months ago can be found with the same errors that still exist today. 
Rarely do the people replying to our complaints ever admit to the errors and in some cases, posts go unnoticed for over two weeks.

- The grading passing score of the final assignment isn’t clear, it is not mentioned anywhere.
- By reviewing the discussion forum, I see many student are failing to do the assignment, and they were given the answer straight by the instructor, I am not sure if that serve the purpose of learning/teaching ?
- I found myself not understanding, not learning, and not gaining the skills I joined to gain or learn about. 
- The assignment estimated time is menitioned about 1 – 2 hrs, however it took me like over 40 hrs to finish, I am not disappointed that I spent much time, I am disappointed that I spent much time and I don’t feel I achieved anything other than copying and pasting codes, I haven’t learned the skills well at all. I don’t feel I am equipped to do such task in real life. I felt at the end I was more like learning how to (copy and paste) codes rather than understanding how to actually code and how code works and how to utilize Flask.
- The learning curve isn’t gradual, the content is patchy and the videos jump from one subject to another without linkage in between.
- Would I recommend this course? absolutely not, I feel the time I spent on the course was a complete waste as I haven’t gained any of the skills I was after gaining. I am finishing this course completely disappointed and frustrated.
- If I have the chance to change something in the course, I would rather put more weight on the labs instead of leaving them simply ungraded – I don’t understand the point for putting labs if they are ungraded, how would the instructor ensure the student is going through the right process of learning?
I believe adding some scoring to the labs would actually help the student learn and proof their learning progress, instead of leaving (50%) of the score weight to a final assignment that many student can’t finish, which they end up simply copying it from the instructor answer on the questions forum.
- I would love to hear some advice from the instructors on how to gain the skills, in both in coding and Flask. Also, I would love to learn more about the real life coding practices, are they also about copying and pasting code without understanding how it actually works?
A bit of background on myself, I have a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering, a Master’s degree in Infrastructure Engineering and Management, plus 20 years in the Civil Engineering, solving various complex problems, and went through many endless courses through my career within university and outside university.

I am sorry to say that this course has by far been the worst course I have ever taken. I have decided to leave the specialization in Devops/Software Engineering also. I feel completely disappointed. ",1
85,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development by IBM",Saumitra K V,"Jun 7, 2019","I would not recommend this course for someone who is completely new to python or programming in general, even though this is a beginner level course. Not only is the course content riddled with typos, but the text following the videos do not match at times making it hard for someone like me (a complete novice to programming) to understand the flow. There are other courses on python and data science out there that one could start with and get familiarised with the terminology first, and then sign up for this one. 
Working with Jupyter workspace and IBM Cloud was also not very user friendly. There were constant errors on bucket names and endpoints while running the code, which left me confused on what was happening (I believe this was the case with other users in the course as well, as seen from the discussion threads for Week 5). 
For instance, the tutorial IBM Object Storage does not clearly state which endpoint to use. For my project I ended up using an endpoint that was created in my credentials inside the JSON object. Due to this my code always gave an error. As it turns out, the correct endpoint to be used was listed elsewhere under IBM Cloud, but this was not clearly explained. I had to check with the course instructors to resolve the issue. I must say that the course instructors were very helpful in answering my questions and clarifying all my doubts promptly. I appreciated that. 
In conclusion, this course is not for someone who does not have any background on programming. Get some basic experience first before coming to this one. ",1

For me, as a newcomer to OOP, it was a confusing mess.  Adequate explanations aren't given.  Things like f-strings are used without any explanation.  No understanding of OOP or how programs are organized is given.  I had to read two books and ask ChatGPT about every single item in order to understand why it is used, and why it is important.

The Excel class was easy for me, because I already had a ton of experience with the program.  It probably would have been equally confusing for a newcomer.  What this cert program needs is an additional class on OOP to provide an overview of programming, and it needs a whole lot more 'Why?' to make sense of the 'How?' that the course teaches.",1

I've been struggling with where to begin (should I take a course on Python? R? What languages are even useful? WTF is cloud computing?) And this course gave me a good starting off point. That said, it wasn't technical AT ALL. It's really just a bunch of ""fireside chats"" with data scientists, talking about the languages they use, what concepts they're used for, what knowledge is necessary and what isn't, etc. If you're looking for a ""roadmap"" to continue learning on Coursera, this is it. 
This is exactly what I feel the college experience gives students that online or self-taught learning lacks: context.

Similar to the point that a data science report should indicate the details and affiliations of the person writing the report, many speakers in the videos apart from the two professors does not have any background information.

Dr. Haider misused some words, such as ""judgmental"" and ""argumentative"".  Without any evidence or examples for support, he claimed that it was more important for a job applicant to have a sense of humor than technical skills.
This course should have named specific techniques used in data science, and how to acquire the knowledge.   Regression was mentioned, but the explanation was inadequate.  Perhaps the explanation should have been omitted.  K-nearest neighbor was mentioned.  
Many students want to know what courses to take next, what computer languages to study, etc.  What are the computer programming languages of the future?
Students cannot learn everything.  Would it make sense for someone to skip some things, and to focus on others?  Should everyone learn Python?  Does everyone need to learn SQL?  What about Tableau?  Is that worthless? 
How should students set their learning priorities in order to achieve a basic or minimal skill set within 3 or 6 or 12 months?

I expect the test to recall about main concept, such as ""What is different between AI, ML, and deep learning?"", ""What is properties of big data?"", ""what is application of regression"". These kind of questions recall things much more important than minor detail I mention above, but they are non existent.

195,What is Data Science? by IBM,Georgi K,"Aug 21, 2020"," [Reviewing the entire IBM Data Science specialization but points are applicable for each course]
I signed up for the IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it anymore. Here’s why:
1. First and foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me but whatever, lets move on.
2. The in-video quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are expected to have memorized content word by word rather than understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.
3. The final assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.
4. We eventually got to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.
5. And my final and biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality content.
6. Now after finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly filled in basically letting them know their specialization if terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfb
I was very saddened by the quality of the specialization and the content and was wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting next week.
In conclusion, I got this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their courses.  ",1
196,What is Data Science? by IBM,Nicholas B,"Feb 3, 2020","Extremely basic introductory course. Unfortunately you don't learn much about actual data science methods.

197,What is Data Science? by IBM,Ashmini G K,"Jul 18, 2021","This was a great introduction to the field of data science. Having videos interspaced with readings made it easier to maintain focus. The speakers in the videos were super engaging and I liked the upfront warning that data science involves continuous learning, and a willingness to look up stuff and practice until you understand how to do new developments in field. As a researcher who writes reports for shareholders, I felt like students could have benefited from a warning that after you figure out 5 possible solutions to a problem, and detail them in your conclusion and recommendations section, few of the stakeholders will actually read or implement the recommendations. But, hey, at least you'll have fun doing the analysis.
Although the e-note format was great in theory, I found the traditional technique of writing stuff down while watching the videos and reading the material to be more useful, as I didn't need to be logged into the site to study my notes.  It's great that both options are available and learners can use the option that best fits their learning style. ",5
198,What is Data Science? by IBM,Shelley,"Sep 23, 2018","The course provides a good overview of data science in general. I particularly liked the definitions of a data scientist and data science.

The course also touches upon hot topic areas that people have heard of but most do not understand - i.e. Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Data Mining and Big Data. I have a much better idea what these terms mean now along with the tools of the trade. The course was quite short and concise. I found it the perfect pace for me. The quizzes matched the content and there was nothing extraneous.

214,What is Data Science? by IBM,Dylan H,"Feb 12, 2019","Was ok.  
1)  For what it was, (predominantly opinion videos) you could probably stand to remove a couple of the videos from the two professors, (especially the second one) without changing the overall effectiveness of the course. 
2)  You might want to work with that second professor, (or just edit the appropriate video) to remove the clear disdain he expresses toward statisticians since a) they're at least just as much a part of data science as computer scientists and are thus due the same degree of respect, and b) some / several of the people taking this course, (such as me) come from a statistics background, and it's really not a good idea to require us to sit there and watch while this prof decides to backhand us all with his not only inappropriate, but, more importantly, inaccurate statements - really not a good way to help us feel welcome as part of the program.
3)  The final question on the final exam was -horribly- rote and pedantic.  I get that you're trying to find something that's easy to peer review, but really - one random person's opinion on how to format a paper?  That was about as unimaginative / uninteresting as you could possibly get and only goes further into making data science seem like it's going to be an incredibly boring-to-other-than-totally-left-brained-control-freak humans.  How about easing it up a bit on the precise content and let people answer more about the Voltaire discussion, (i.e. thinking about how you want to present the results even before writing the report)?  How about having people talk about the first professor's discussion of what he did with the Toronto busses - going off on his own to acquire priorly-unrelated data to determine correlations?  These are the kinds of things that are going to help someone become a good data scientist later in life, not whether they could list 10 italicized bullet points about how precisely one form of report, (i.e. a very formal, long form - often only used in its entirety in academia and generally inappropriate in other contexts).",3

There were countless errors in the IBM voiced-over, animation videos. For example saying that data mining is ""automated"" when it was just explained that data priming - which is often highly manual at the outset - is an important part of the first steps of data mining. It is absolutely NOT inherently an automated process from end to end. 
The final ""capstone"" assignment which was essentially regurgitation was graded incorrectly. Especially with respect to the final reading. Students were asked to list the ""main"" sections of what should constitute a report to be given to stakeholders following data science based research. Firstly, dictating sections is stupid as you need to customise to your audience and NO, doing it that way should never be prescribed as universal. Secondly, even adhering strictly to what the reading said and ONLY what the reading said, the grading criteria was WRONG. How on earth did you list Appendices, CLEARLY stated as OPTIONAL as one of the 10 main sections? Not only that, you listed sub-sections as whole sections. For students that got the answer correct, I graded them as such and commented that I'm doing this because the criteria was in fact erroneous. 
It's one MOOC. How hard is it to get the basics right? What happened to the IBM culture that used to make software engineers write all their code without a compiler to MAKE SURE what they were building was as correct as possible before compiling because of a focus on quality?
  Amateur hour over here. Not inspiring.   ",2
220,What is Data Science? by IBM,SHANNON L H,"Sep 13, 2019","Was pretty upset that the answers on the final assignment were incorrect according to the course materials.  I am an OCD person that is very by the book, who studies and seeks my answers directly from the materials.  I am hear to learn and depend on you to have accurate learning materials and tests that follow the course materials.  
I create procedure manuals for staff.  One of the first things I do when I finish a new manual, is go through each thing, step by step, to make sure it is accurate.  My manuals are for a handful of people, your learning materials are for thousands of people, many of which have language barriers, as English is not their first language.  So this makes it even more important for your assignments/tests to be extremely clear in their questions and the answers correct according to the course material.  When you have a tremendous amount of complaints about this on the discussion forums and no one of power is doing anything to correct this, this is a major issue.
I had started a specialization with Coursera a few months before and quit near the end of course two due to extreme frustration with these same issues.  I love the idea of these specializations, and would love to take many of them.  I hope and pray that the rest of this course will be a vast improvement over the last assignment in Course 1 week 3.",2
221,What is Data Science? by IBM,Krishna B,"May 5, 2020","Honestly, I just expected too much from this course. It ended before I could even fully realise it had begun. Grading seemed to be less along the lines of ""We want you to understand this"" and more along the lines of ""We want you to memorise a specific quote from a puzzlingly long video that you won't feel like watching throughout, and will follow up with a reading which is more or less a transcript of the video.""
Take up the course if you've never come across the terms ""data science"" in your life. Otherwise, it's just time and cognitive effort down the drain. This course is basically clickbait that claims to need 3 weeks of your time, but can be completed in a single hour if you're a fast reader and have a long lunch break at work.",2
222,What is Data Science? by IBM,Greice F,"May 15, 2019","- Texts have poor quality so they are hard to read and the references are not available.
 - No extra materials are available.
 - The quiz are pointless: you can answer without understand the text or the videos. You just need to find the key words on the text, no need to comprehend it. 
 - The videos are very boring. They are sometimes contradictory. Some questions are not answered and others are answered over and over again.

Furthermore, the testemonials appear to be randomly picked students who say what they think they're supposed to say, or just give their own opinion; this contributes very little to the viewer's actual learning.

237,What is Data Science? by IBM,Julian W,"Jan 13, 2020","Really disappointed with the whole specialisation... I am leaving this review here because probably you might not check the others courses before you start it. 
Specialisation is short and it is the only good thing about it. It took me I think 10-12 hours to do it.
So first of all the whole thing is not really informative. A lack of videos - Most of the time there is only ""power-point""presentation with code written on it.  I don't really understand why they have narrator who just read text - no emotions almost like a machine.
Courses:
1. You will spend a lot of time learning listening to videos about how sexy is to be data scientist... and that parents start sending their daughters for data science (sic!), and that it is a new science... Plus some rather simple information which you rather know taking into consideration you want to study it online. At least it is nice to watch - there is life in it.
2. You will spend the whole course watching different notebooks like jupyter R studio etc . without really learning any useful stuff. In the end you will just click run to create some already written commands in python. Yeap that's it.  I know it is intro but adding 1 +1 third time in different console... 
3.  You will learn some methodology - A lot of complicated knowledge read by narrator who is not making it easier or more interesting. Almost like somebody reading you technical book...
4. SQL - you will try to learn it from presentations. I think there are no proper videos just images in narrated power point presentation. I watched some coursera lectures about sql before but still I had problems with following it. To make it worst you will have to use IBM products which are FREE - other reviews are probably outdated. The problem is that materials from this course are also outdated. So they are presenting you IBM tool-set which is already different. It is a problem because they are not even trying to show how they work just where to click. 
I managed, you will too but, IBM, please do better.  ",1
238,What is Data Science? by IBM,James M,"Jul 24, 2023","This was an absolutely miserable process.

It is absolutely unbelievable that this passed and acceptable and to the standard for IBM. I learned absolutely 0 useful information, completed the entire course in under an hour, and have nothing but wasted time to show for it. To top it all off one of the end exams is a peer reviewed assignment which is absolute nonsense, and the other is closer to trivia about the required readings than anything else. The cert, or badge, or whatever garbage I'll be getting for this isn't worth the electricity it took to turn on my computer and complete it.

The videos were accessible, done by engaging instructors who were 'TV-ready' - great eye contact, speech patterns and teachers. There were additional lessons and interviews with data professionals that were interesting by bloated the time needed to complete this course.  Inspite of having good instructors, the course seemed to lack focus at times, and some topics were revisited multiple times, even after demonstrating competency. It was fustrating in the discusson forums to see some students completing assignments while others just entered a single word instead of uploading a document in order to pass out of the assignments. It makes on question the value of the certificate. Moreover, the instructions often required you to revisit assignments and be quizzed on the same interpersonal skill and project management ideas you had demonstrated proficiency in. This wasn't done as a stepping stone to another source of information, but was just done in a way that was, at time, painfully redundant. I am a woman and I appreciate having women as instructors in this industry. That being said, only having women as the instructors in lessons on 'soft skills' may have been inclusive but signaled that being able to communicate, plan and work with colleagues professionally was not something men  value.

390,Introduction to Data Analytics by IBM,Emily C,"Dec 21, 2020","This course is a lot of lectures and quizzes with just one hands-on assignment. This makes sense because the purpose of the course was to give an overview of data analytics. I'm hoping the next courses in the series will be more hands-on. 
The instructors should consider revising or eliminating the section about women in data analytics in week 5. It was shocking to hear women in the field say that their male coworkers are visibly disappointed to find themselves working alongside women. To have that followed by advice that women learn to speak up and not ""use their gender as a crutch"" was extremely disappointing. It left me with the impression that the authors of this course are trying to actively keep women out of the profession. I'm sure that wasn't the intention, but the authors need to think about what purpose that video is serving.",2

394,Introduction to Data Analytics by IBM,Alan P,"Jun 8, 2021","A course in mediocrity ... while I appreciate that the course is just an introductory course, there is a lot of material that is presented in a subjective imprecise manner with little or no references to Jeff Jonas' work in Big Data Analytics or the academic work that should be presented here as a stepping stone that leads up to the Big-Data Analytics that it should serve well.  It appears that nobody has performed a technical editorial review of the transcripts for each video; there are far too many errors in the text and punctuation meaning that it actually does a poor or degrading service to students that do not speak English as their native language (they are seeing and learning errors that should be edited out).  As for the Coursera methodology ... one should not expect much from this course ... .  For example, multiple choice quiz/exam questions might be easy for lazy instructors and computer-bots to grade, but they are woefully inadequate to actually teach and confirm a student's aptitude and inherent understanding of any subject.  While I will admit that the quiz questions are mostly simple or direct quotes from the material presented, it does little to confirm a student's in-depth knowledge or understanding.  The concept of having assignments is fine but casting all care and assessment of a student's performance on these submissions to other students' peer reviews as the only means of grading and scoring student's work is a dereliction of duty and responsibility on the part of the instructors (who appear to be absent and uncaring).  I equate taking this type of Coursera course to be like learning solely from the random members of the public ... one can only expect to achieve the level of proficiency that is already achieved by the members of the general public who are willing to take a course like this and that is fraught with all of their errors, opinions, and misunderstandings or limited abilities to understand the language or writing style of the student whose work they are reviewing.  When encountering a mediocre reviewer that is full of the overly applied optimism and positivism, the reviewer becomes irrationally harsh in their review or irrationally generous ... the rubric from which they are supposed to be applying their peer review is far too random and far too unfair.  
In academic studies, the neophyte deserves to be taught by the master.  It is clear that this material has not been scrutinized, the Coursera methodology far too inadequate, and the material either not or poorly edited by a lay-person who is merely familiar with Data Analytics to the level of qualification of a novice.  I am completely underwhelmed by this as an introductory course on Data Analytics.  I'm very suspect and doubtful that this will suffice for training of members of my organization.  
A word to the wise is sufficient; Coursera, you need to step up your game and teach to achieve academic standards that can achieve accreditation.  Otherwise, back off and share good information in the concept of training; stop attempting to masquerade as education.  ",2

Most people who join coursera are looking for courses to improve their skills and knowledge, so they can be more competitive in the market. This course Is mostly just listing different kind of data analytics softwares and the functions of them, instead of teaching any specific software. We are here to learn the functions of the software, how to use the it in solving problems, not just names of these softwares. Another big part of this course is about Data Analytics professionals talking about how great is the career as Data Analytics...well, we already know. That's why we are here to learn.

515,Python Project for Data Science by IBM,Maria S,"Feb 20, 2021","[[suggestions for improvements included]]
As a teacher, I understand that trying new materials means experimenting and fixing as you go, but there should be a disclaimer for the students switching from the previous version. Students encouraged to switch to newer version were promised a better experience with updated materials and that is not what I got.  
Instruction and Hands on Activity are not properly set-up to help students succeed in the final project. The hands on activities don't have solutions so one can't check if they are understanding. The final project took hours to complete because their was not enough guidance. Please include the following in your directions or hands on activities: 
1) How to reset the index without deleting a column
2) How to change the types of a column in a dataframe
3) what it means it means to ""save"" the reset_index (b/c the term  ""save"" wasn't used in the previous version or hands on Activity)
4) A sample code on how to make a dataframe using a loop while webscraping
5) A intro and example on how to use BeautifulSoup
Ps. Using the forum to read how other students bypassed their issues was helpful! ",2
516,Python Project for Data Science by IBM,Shaun D,"Feb 21, 2021","This course is:
a) Poorly explained. There are literally zero 'lessons' or accompanying videos. Also, the vast bulk of the content is completely new - as far as I'm aware 'web scraping' was not been covered by any previous course. There really should be some supporting video material from an instructor - I have found myself searching on forums and google for explanations - a strong sign that the course content did not prepare or teach me very well at all.
b) Too hard! I spent far too long on small steps in the labs because had no idea how to do something that seems like it should be trivial. These steps blocked me from completing the questions. I eventually got there through dumb luck and referring to other students help in the forums. I still don't understand what it is I am supposed to have actually done as no advice or example solution is given for that step.
c) Very frustrating for anyone like myself who has nearly completely the specialisation. After months of following a scheduled course structure then to be thrown into a new topic with minimal / no lessons and then tested feels unfair and completely unnecessary for anyone who paid to start the specialisation when it was not part of the overall syllabus.
Overall I wouldn't mind about the new course if I felt like I had actually learnt something useful. Instead, this course has been very frustrating throughout and largely forgettable.",1
517,Python Project for Data Science by IBM,Sam H,"Feb 22, 2021","This course is basically the equivalent of someone being told theoretically how to swim. And then being thrown directly into the deep end, and told to learn as they go.

my first downloaded but works fine the second time.  The final assignment took longer than 30min because you must find and learn the
new codes required to complete the project yourself, there were no teaching in the class! The submission and grading are being changed during the weeklong
course.  I am glad there were help from Discussion Forum contributors/volunteers who is also taking the class, seems everyone is struggling on similar topics.

 But please, add more explainations about what the students are working with. I expect the course I paid for to actually teach me new features about the new (for me) python library, but not only force me to read the documentation on the internet and hectically look for answers on StackOverflow. It's good that a course should encourage such self-learning, but if it's only self-learning, then the course should be free.",2

533,Python Project for Data Science by IBM,Bernardo V R,"Feb 28, 2021","I appreciated the more hands approach of the course. I would just help guide the students a bit better i. e. some things weren't fully explained such as resetting the index or finding the max value of a particular column, etc., which in turn lead to Google searching and using stackoverflow for answers. 
All in all not a great course but not a bad one either. If they tweak it a bit in order to clarify some of the confusion, I think it has potential, especially for hands on learners such as myself. ",3
534,Python Project for Data Science by IBM,Jacob B,"Mar 7, 2021","This course was added to the curriculum for the IBM Data Science course while I was already enrolled in Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python. After finishing that course, Coursera wouldn't allow me to enroll in the next course, Data Analysis with Python. I was notified, ""you are currently enrolled in an old version of the specialization. Upgrade the specialization to continue with your purchase."" When I click to upgrade, there's an error. I assumed this was due to the addition of Python Project for Data Science, so I thought I would start this course instead of moving on to the next course. Coursera charged me $49 to add the Python Project for Data Science course, when I was under the impression that all courses are included in my subscription fee.
I do think it's important to be able to pull data from HTML, and how that process works was interesting. However, I found that the labs, especially the final assessment, did not follow very closely with the videos. This course required a lot more independent research when compared to other courses in the curriculum. There were multiple typos in the labs, and the whole thing felt thrown together as an afterthought. Now it's preventing me from enrolling in other courses until I figure out how to upgrade the version I'm enrolled in.",2

There are no videos, the labs do not explain half of the content and I had to Google most of the solutions, which wasted a few weeks and my money to pay for Coursera.
The labs also contain incorrect links that are needed to pull data from wensite when webscraping.
The labs are even out of date, so the libraries that are pre-coded to install at the beginning don't cover the code needed to complete the lab... which is part of the graded assignment.
Also, there has not been any explanation of how to run Python in your terminal or in an interpreter, so the course leaves out any practical application as is strictly theoretical.
There are also spelling mistake throughout and you must use the Discussion Forums to figure out why the labs are broken. ",1

643,Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM,Georgi K,"Aug 21, 2020"," [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for each course]
I signed up for the IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it anymore. Here’s why:
1. First and foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me but whatever, lets move on.
2. The in-video quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are expected to have memorized content word by word rather than understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.
3. The final assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.
4. We eventually got to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.
5. And my final and biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality content.
6. Now after finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly filled in basically letting them know their specialization if terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfb
I was very saddened by the quality of the specialization and the content and was wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting next week.
In conclusion, I got this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their courses.  ",1

656,Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM,Thomas F,"Jan 3, 2021","The information is made available, but it is just purely death by powerpoint with a scripted voiceover. There is zero intimate tutoring. This applies to all of the IBM Data Science professional certificate. 
My advice on how to improve this course is to take a look at courses such as those in the Python for Everybody specialisation with Dr Charles ""Chuck"" Severance. When he teaches there are powerpoints, but he is intimately explaining what is happening, with the camera switching between him and his powerpoint which he is actively annotating and explaining. That is a much better teaching resource. With the IBM courses, not once have I even seen an image of the tutors or had any detailed explanation or evaluation from a human - it is purely a script describing a powerpoint slide throwing in as many meaningless business-speech words as possible, almost an advertisement for IBM services which I have the luxury of paying for. 
The information is there and that is why I have not rated this as low as possible (there really are some dodgy courses out there!), and I will complete the professional certificate I paid for, but to me, this style of teaching is very impersonal and you really do feel like just a cash-cow for the company rather than a valued learner.

657,Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM,Ahmed A,"Oct 8, 2020","I'm taking it as part of the IBM Data Science professional certificate. Course is OK for an introducion to SQL, although I thought there was too much emphasis on IBM DB2 and nothing else. Would have liked them to show us how to use another API, or how to interface with open source databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
I have experience in programming and debugging and therefore did not find this to bother me, but the lack of guidance on how to install missing packages or troubleshoot connexions can be really frustrating for inexperienced people. It's best you do all the assignments in an IBM environment or else you will find yourself troubleshooting for hours on end.
Getting the cvs's for the final assessment was a pain because the links to them were broken! had to search through the forums to find alternative links, which points to a lack to reactivity from the guys in not updating their course material.
That being said I learnt quite a lot from this course, more python and other databases and I would have given 4 stars.

Also, sometimes we are asked to write several queries but screenshoot to submit only one of them, but in grading the submission one of the grading criteria asks about other queries that was not asked to screenshoot and upload.

As i'm not a english native speaker, I found the spelling mistakes and syntax errors of the exercises really confusing, same thing for the videos.
 I learned a lot principally from external sources, but I enjoyed the exercises and exams. I had to read a lot of different websites to understand what I was doing (really thankful to the SQLBolt website) .
 Gladly I ended up with a 100% calification, and i'm very happy as I didn't even know what SQL was but I find that the videos are very short and not useful.
 My recommendations is to read the notebooks, read outside sources to learn about the concepts, and to don't spent too much time to understand the videos before first searching about those things at google. For example, at first week i highlly recommend to learn from the turorials of  SQLBolt and W3. Later I recommend some outside guides on how to use MySQL in python, and SQL .

Unfortunately, the course is not designed well for comprehension. The instructor glosses over things very quickly, and fails to define crucial terms and concepts. For instance, he never once says ""this is the formula for deriving the standard deviation,"" instead he only ever says ""now we will standardize"" and you need to know what he means. When calculating probability in the early lessons, he does not pause to help you learn how to assign A and B, nor does he stop to say which values he has assigned to A and which to B.  As of May 2020, halfway into what I believe is the first iteration of the course, the Forums were not turned on so we cannot seek help from our classmates, even though about 3,000 are currently enrolled.  I'm five weeks in and completely undecided about whether to continue or not; I am not learning statistics; for the most part I am just retaking the tests over and over again until I pass.  Please at a minimum turn on the forums for students.  But also consider re-recording the Probability section to include more instruction about how to assign variables to A and B, and to more clearly specify what the teacher considers to be A and B in the course examples.

I think the learning materials of this course are valuable and the instructor, professor Guenther Walther is  excellent. However, for global students, this course is awful, comparing with the other beginner level courses in Coursera,  A lot of concepts in the videos are not introduced clearly, for example, what is median? How to find the median? How to distinguish dependent variables from independent variables?  What is  a sample? What is a category? What is replacement for a draw? When should be replacement? I think the instructor assumed every student here is a Stanford student or an American student.
To be honest, this course is not supportive to students because it doesn't open the discussion forum for students to discuss the problems coming from the materials and correct the incorrect calculation in the instruction.  In addition, there is not any handout to  help students  to summarize what are taught in the module or give more examples. Only quizzes, but no exercises. These makes the learning  here generate a lot of difficulties and failures despite there are explanations following the quizzes.

Otherwise, the course is not self-sufficient to teach the concepts of statistics and to make you use them.
Week 1: very fast, but manageable
Week 2: very fast, lacks explanations, not complete information to solve the test. In the examples, it was not clear what A and B represent. Later, during the test, I could not even manage to assign propabilities. For example, could it be the probability of ""known answer"" in ""correct answer"" or ""correct answer"" in ""all answers"", how to take into account the total number of questions and the fact that only the first question was solved. Disaster!

1) The style was pure ""monkey see/monkey do"" where he stated a technique and then plugged in numbers. He often provided no intuition or mathematical rigor as to why they work. Understanding the ""why"" is key to long term retention of the information, and I found myself having to spend a lot of time outside the course to learn that.
2) There are no labs to get hands-on practice trying the techniques in Python or R or some other environment.
3) Week 6 (bootstrap) was particularly bad. I would suggest removing that from the curriculum as it is beyond saving and isn't core to the curriculum.
4) Some important techniques, such as defining alpha and beta levels for a test and how to adjust the tests to meet those goals, was not covered at all. In fact, type 2 errors was not covered.
5) Those are the main reasons for a 1 star review, but I want to add; some of the pop-up questions in the lessons ask detailed questions about the slide being shown, but the pop-up covers the slide. Please make sure there is enough context in each pop-up.",1

783,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Erica A,"Jun 30, 2023",I would not call this beginner at all. You get a short 5-10min lecture and then are expected to apply a concept in a quiz. A concept that you aren't really truly taught in the lecture. There are no exercises or practice to learn and comprehend the subject of each week's lecture.  After 4 weeks of trying to make a go of this course I am unenrolling as I feel it isn't teaching me anything. I have had to go to other outlets to research and learn only to return to the quizzes and try and answer questions. How this course is so highly rated is beyond me as I see the course discussions also show other students having same issues as myself. ,1
784,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Steve P,"Aug 30, 2022",Extremely rushed course with few examples and just slides of monotenous droning over formulas thrown on screen.,2
785,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Chana E F,"Dec 8, 2022","I don’t understand why we were given two questions on the quiz that we were never taught to solve. I really would have appreciated the instructor giving a few example problems and step by step solution methods. I am going to wind up dropping the class because the teaching method of skipping over processes is completely ineffective, and it is demoralizing for those with math disabilities. That is why I took a beginner class in the first place. 
Please, for the sake of your students, address that shortcoming in order that those who are no math professors may learn. Setting up your beginner students for failure is completely unfair and unkind. Thank you. ",1
786,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Utkarsh K,"May 25, 2023","I am thrilled to share my five-star review for the ""Introductory to Statistics"" course offered by Stanford University through Coursera. This course has exceeded my expectations and has been an incredible learning experience.
Professor Guenther Walther, with his vast knowledge and expertise in statistics, delivered the course content in an engaging and comprehensive manner. His ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and understandable way truly made a difference in my learning journey. I appreciate his dedication to providing a high-quality educational experience.

It is a refresh since it does not really explain many concepts and the ones it does, are very, very succinct. My goal was to refresh and get other kind of explanations for stats concepts, so, considering that goal, it was a great course, the explanations are concise and simple (most of the time). But if you're new to stats and want to really learn and understand the concepts in depth, this course may not be ideal as you'll probably need complementary material.",4
802,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Sun,"Mar 13, 2022","The course touches upon the major basic concepts of statistics, but it woud be a bit difficult for people who do not have much mathematical background. The explanations are highly mathematically conceptional, using a lot of mathematical symbols and equations, instead of just giving simple examples that everybody can easily understand. Nevertheless, the course is highly efficient for people who are seeking to get to know as many basic concepts as they can in a short period of time.",4
803,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Corvin L,"Jun 11, 2022","I walked into this course with basic knowledge of statistics. Relearning this course, I can see that the concepts taught to me before were present and well taught. However, I think the course is too fast-paced and sometimes, the professor fails to properly go in-depth about the formula and how to answer the said question. It seemed like he was on a time budget to teach us statistics. I do believe that this course IS sufficient but I feel as the course is too rushed. ",3
804,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Alex B,"May 12, 2023","Incredibly dry, rushed, and not at all introductory lectures. Weeks 1-4 were relatively easy to follow along with, coupled with some Googling of more difficult concepts, but from Week 5 on there is a huge spike in difficulty. After struggling along, I gave up midway through Week 6. The lectures rely heavily on advanced formulas using esoteric notation that is almost never explained. Core concepts are also introduced quickly with a generic definition, and then are never really explained again. For a beginner, this is incredibly frustrating as I found myself having to go back to previous lectures just to understand a 15-second example of a concept that relies on 4-5 previous concepts. Finally, sometimes there is a reason given why a certain calculation is being done, but not always, which leads to more confusion. As many others have noted, this is more of an intermediate/refresher course for people already familiar with statistical concepts, but beginners should steer clear.",2
805,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Ali M,"Feb 20, 2024",This course is not an introductory course! It is more like a summary of statistics from beginner to advanced.

808,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Vidhur V,"Jul 11, 2023","Overall, I think this Intro to Statistics class provided a great amount of content to understand the Fundamentals.

809,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Roderick R,"Aug 6, 2023",Excellent review that worked for me.

836,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Vlad B,"Sep 24, 2022","Good:
- there is enough material to be called Introduction to Statistics.
- lecture questions & quizzes for application of critical thinking.
- formulas are not complicated by symbols, which makes it easier for you to understand them and reread
- Normal Approximation is the best topic described here.
Bad:
- lecture slides don't really complement intstructor's speech and vice versa. In fact, the instructor repeats the text on the slides in most cases
- lecture slides contain a lot of text which is not well structured. They also contain very few illustrative figures and tables, but where they are, you immediately understand what it is about ( e.g. Normal Approximation).
Due to the fact that most of the theory is presented in dry text, I advise you to use Excel (or similar tools) to understand what it is about.",3
837,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Piotr,"Dec 3, 2022","Very condensed course with a clear structure, intelligently designed quizzes, and a good lecturer.  
However, I needed to do a lot of additional reading from other sources to understand the content. IMHO, the course could have much more explanations on the topics and provide much more practical exercises. I rather see the course as a basic framework for your own, deepened learning that as a self-sufficient training.",3
838,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Heybin J,"Nov 3, 2022","This is hard to say for beginners.

841,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Allan G,"Jan 4, 2023","I recently tutored  a student in an introduction to statistics course by reading the textbook and learning as he learned.  While I gained a basis understanding of statistics, I found that the textbook (Statistics, Unlocking the Power of Data) somewhat confusing and I wanted to take another statistics course to try and clarify basic concepts that I  felt were not explained well in that course, so I took this course.  I found this course to be so formula - intense that the basic concepts were lost in the discussion of the formulae and many were not clearly explained.  Another drawback was that the graphs in the videos were blurry and one could only read the designations on the x and y axes by referring to the slides separately, which was distracting.  I kept moving through the course, determined to finish it and evaluate the concepts that were being discussed, but it was very disorienting to follow the formulae and try to glean their import as related to the concept being discussed. I passed the quizzes by keeping a list of the correct answers for each attempt (many of which I chose at random) and finally passing by the process of elimination.  If  I had not had previous knowledge of statistics, this course would have not been helpful.   Even so, it did not significantly increase my knowledge of statistics.",2
842,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Japheth C,"Jan 12, 2023","This is more fitting to someone who has a background in mathematics and statistics and wants to refresh their knowledge (and potentially learn some additional topics in Statistica Analysis). If you have never done any statistics and probability before you will struggle or lose the motivation to complete the course.
The lecturer is clearly knowledgeable in the area, however, there needs to be a lot more content to practice. I think having more examples to explain concepts and more examples to practice will be a big plus.
Weeks 1 to 3 and maybe 4 will be a breeze through if you have some stats background. Otherwise, you struggle. 
For me it was decent. I was able to refresh my knowledge but learnt of new concepts. Those concepts I will have to find other material to read in order to fully understand them.",2
843,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Ben H,"Jul 11, 2023","This course covers a lot of relevant material. However much of the material is covered WAY too fast to be digested. For example the material on ANOVA is basically incomprehensible. Furthermore the course is glitchy, with questions popping up while the lecture is ongoing and often closing before you have a chance to answer. This course could definitely be improved.",2
844,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Seb G,"Dec 12, 2023","While the course covers a lot of material and gives a good overview,  the explanations are often rushed and there's not emphasis on working through examples, especially in the later weeks (after week 4). It's also odd that there are no suggestions for extra reading, when extra reading is almost going to be required to really master any of the material. ",2
845,Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University,Wendy K M,"Nov 8, 2022","This course took me longer than expected.

Some questions are redundant such as the name of the person who designed the data science methodology or  questions specific to the case study and does not necessarily provide insight into general concepts.
3) Simply reading what is in the slides is not a good use of videos and cannot keep the focus of the students for a long time.
4) This course might be located after the Python for Data Science course or even later so that the students could have a more meaningful final assignment, actually applying what they learned on a small data set.

934,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Akshata H,"Apr 16, 2023","Data science methodology refers to the process of identifying business problems, collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, analyzing it using statistical and machine learning techniques, and presenting insights to stakeholders.
The data science methodology usually consists of the following steps:
Define the Problem: In this step, the business problem is identified and clearly defined. It is important to understand the problem thoroughly in order to identify the relevant data and analysis techniques.
Collect the Data: In this step, the relevant data is collected from various sources. The data can be structured or unstructured and may require cleaning or preprocessing before analysis.
Data Preparation: This step involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and consistency. This includes removing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data as needed.
Data Analysis: In this step, statistical and machine learning techniques are used to analyze the data and uncover patterns and relationships. This can include techniques such as clustering, regression, and classification.
Model Development: Once the analysis is complete, models are developed to make predictions or classify new data. This can involve building machine learning models such as decision trees, neural networks, or support vector machines.
Model Evaluation: In this step, the models are evaluated using various metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.
Deployment: Finally, the insights and models are presented to stakeholders and deployed in the business process to improve decision making and operations.
Overall, the data science methodology provides a structured approach to solving business problems and extracting insights from data. By following this methodology, data scientists can ensure that their analysis is thorough, accurate, and relevant to the business problem at hand.",5

947,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Georgi K,"Aug 21, 2020"," [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for
each course]
I signed up for the
IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start
it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually
started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making
my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of
bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses
and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it
anymore. Here’s why:
1. First and
foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at
least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other
students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me
but whatever, lets move on.
2. The in-video
quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are
expected to have memorized content word by word rather than
understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of
the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.
3. The final
assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which
IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing
stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.
4. We eventually got
to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter
notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no
proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read
python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though
python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.
5. And my final and
biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel
like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred
excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells
here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM
Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing
problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my
assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open
source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter
they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more
focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality
content.
6. Now after
finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly
filled in basically letting them know their specialization if
terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent
them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this
course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to
IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfb
I was very saddened
by the quality of the specialization and the content and was
wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses
but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out
it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would
recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting
next week.
In conclusion, I got
this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to
say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated
by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their
courses.  ",1
948,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Hakki K,"Jul 9, 2020","Hi,
I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.

949,Data Science Methodology by IBM,André K,"May 20, 2020","Unfortunately, this particular course dissonates a lot from the previous ones made by IBM on Coursera. The material is very poor, the narration is very fast (we're not all native English speakers!) and most of the time it doesn't match what we see on the screen. It's completely confusing, it's impossible to aprehend any information on these videos. The study case is far from a good example to be understood, it only makes the classes even more confusing than they are.
The notebooks are of very poor interaction, and even the quizzes and exams are not pedagogic. I really felt very much frustrated with this particular course and I hope no other will be as bad as this one, as I felt I had just wasted time and money doing it. I really felt like I've learned nothing from it. Reading the ""IBMOpenSource_FoundationalMethologyforDataScience"" 3 times and then making an exam about it would be 10 times more effective learning than wasting hours on this terrible course.
I am really shocked with the lack of quality of this particular course, comparing to the other which are simply amazing. Please, substitute this course ASAP for a good one, because I am sure it is lowering the overall quality perception of anyone who is following the 9 courses to reach the certificate.
Sorry about the honesty, but it was very hard to go through this course. I am still shocked about the difference between this one and the others IBM has offered.
Thanks!",1
950,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Jakub M,"Feb 6, 2020","Listen - I am the last person to give something a one-star review. Especially on Coursera where all the courses I did were very good at least. This debacle of a course is my first disappointment with a content offered by this platform.
You can see the drastic drop in quality between the first course in the certificate and this one. Poor videos which offered very little value - I felt like I was sitting on a corporate meeting and listening to a boring PowerPoint presentation.
The whole model is not very helpful to understand those things. Cooking metaphor is not very helpful as it feels very forced. The model has far too many stages to actually be useful for grasping the concepts - especially because the stages are very intertwined. 
Poor-quality videos which look like a low-effort PP presentation, boring and monotone voice. Remove this from the certificate or improve this.",1
951,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Niall B,"Mar 31, 2020","The resources for this course could be improved - the Skills Lab environment is not performant and there have been problems with the associated links. The Watson video needs updating to reflect the significant changes IBM have made to the interface. I found the use-case to be jargon-heavy. The overall delivery of content is extremely dry and could be made more engaging. Overall, a disappointing course. I am doing the specialisation in order and frankly I would give all 3 of the modules I've completed a very low rating - the presentation of material is outdated and the resources woeful. I expected more from IBM. ",1
952,Data Science Methodology by IBM,jason M,"Dec 22, 2020","Did not find this course very helpful. Too much priority on the case study in favor of diving through each of the steps in the methodology first.  
I would recommending restructuring course to more holistically define each step in the methedology and save the case study for the final 'week' before the assignment.
I found the below link through a google search, and reviewing this was more helpful than the time i spent in the course.

953,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Roman S,"Apr 11, 2020","Actually a really interesting topic but unfortunately made quite poorly. Visuals were complicated, had spelling mistakes and often went at 1 slide / 60 seconds which meant you had no idea which part of the wall of text the tutor was reading. The extremely monotone voice relapsed my attention in the first 10 seconds...",1
954,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Mentor M,"Nov 25, 2019","The course is outdated needs major improvement, the instructor is so messy, he has taken a theme with a hospital which is so hard to understand from people that don't have a medical background! Also, the instructor's voice is depressive, and the video provided had almost no relation to what he was saying. ",1
955,Data Science Methodology by IBM,abdullah y a,"Mar 17, 2020","the main issue with this course is the ibm skills network lab, it have much much errors and lags and to much delay , some times if I closed the tab of the lab i can't reopen it which cause  slowdown to my progress in this course and skip many things and labs . Otherwise everything is ok ",1
956,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Amber Z Q,"Jul 4, 2019","It's like being taught by a robot. It's just not as effective when the ""teacher"" doesn't communicate to you like a human. It feels like it was just a voice reading a book to you without proper explanation. As a result this course was unnecessarily difficult to understand. ",1
957,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Parth J,"Feb 9, 2020","Not conducted in the way it should be. Too complex to comprehend and difficult to correlate sometimes. Speaker's language was mechanically scripted, boring and non interactive. Important topic barely touched the the surface where deep explanation was required.",1
958,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Omar L,"Apr 7, 2019",Very little time is spent explaining in detail the various stages of the data science methodology. also the case study used to illustrate the methodology is unnecessarily complicated. This course needs a refresh.,1
959,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Saqibur R,"Apr 5, 2020",Poorly structured and doesn't teach you as much as you might think. A lot of the labs don't work and often takes forever to load if you're lucky. Do not recommend.,1
960,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Ioana R,"Mar 12, 2020",The videos were hectic with information. I felt the need for more explanations or reading material. I am not sure how to apply what I learned in this course. ,1
961,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Adan A,"May 12, 2020",very boring and very difficult case study ... This is one of the worst course and also instructor seems like some kind of robot is talking to us,1

963,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Kamila K,"Dec 29, 2019",This feels like a massive waste of time. If I didn't need to complete it for the certification it would not be completed. ,1
964,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Amiya R B,"Feb 18, 2020",I think the trainer just read out some material prepared by him. concepts are uncleared to me. bad experience,1
965,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Shamir P,"Apr 24, 2020","Prior to undertaking this course, my experience with data science methodology was non-existent. I was not aware of the robust framework developed by John Rollins at IBM, and how it could be used to solve a problem for a business - even if data science was not the end goal. A key lesson from the course as my takeaway would be that it taught me to ask more questions, but more importantly to keep asking questions from different angles.
The course provided me with an invaluable shift in the way that I think about classifying a problem, analysing a problem and then the numerous methods that are available to me when developing a solution.
I would strongly recommend this course even to non-data scientists who require problem-solving tools for their work.
Well laid out, although I do wish that the videos provided a bit more detail on other reading references or articles to gain deeper insights on some of the concepts. (Google definitely helped though).",5
966,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Austin F,"Nov 8, 2020","This is the third course in IBM Professional Data Scientist Certificate, and it so far is by far the best.  Some of it was that there was actual material to learn.  The first course was data science hype videos.  Like a video version of the book ""Competing on Analytics"" or a long-form Businessweek article.  The second course just seemed to be hyping / explaining IBM's watson ecosystem, but often with clunky instructions.  This course had some substance to it.  Also, whenever the IBM ecosystem needed to be used, it just took one click to open the notebook that was needed.  No four-page instruction handout that doesn't work well if you already have an account.  Just a single link.  It was beautifully simple execution.",5
967,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Raíssa B T,"Apr 14, 2020","I appreciate the classes and this whole course. The content is groundbreaking to me! It's such a gift to have learning materials from IBM. Thank you very much.
I like the content but the way it has been ministered/taught could be more dynamic. I like the short and directly-to-the-point videos, but I guess to make comprehension more direct. I mean that if the written information appeared as soon as the speaker mentioned that, it could be more didatic for the student. Sometimes, I didn't know if I payed attention to the written content or to the spoken content. As I am not a native English speaker, for me was sometimes chalenging, thus made me read e watch many times the videos.",5
968,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Abhijeet C,"Jul 22, 2023"," The IBM Data Science Methodology course aims to equip individuals with the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary for data science. The course covers data collection, preparation, modelling, evaluation, and implementation of data-driven solutions. Participants typically learn how to utilize popular data science tools and techniques, such as programming languages like Python and R, data visualization methods, and machine learning algorithms. To gain more insights into the course content and quality, refer to online reviews and testimonials from previous participants. You can also access the course materials directly through IBM's official website or learning platforms.  ",5
969,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Kristina V,"Jun 20, 2023","I recently had the opportunity to participate in a course that I found to be immensely valuable and thoughtfully designed. The course content was delivered in a manner that ensured optimal understanding and retention of the information.
Throughout the course, the instructor consistently demonstrated a remarkable ability to provide information and then reinforce its importance by contextualizing it within the broader scope of the subject matter. This teaching approach greatly enhanced my comprehension and allowed me to grasp the significance of each concept presented.",5
970,Data Science Methodology by IBM,J C V,"Sep 12, 2019","Gives the basic understanding of the methodologies involved in data science domain. Outlines the step-by-step stages of the methodologies. Allows you to think like a data scientist for the final project (although not extensively). Didn't cover all the possible models that a data scientist uses on a daily basis. This course tries to explain the things with the help of case studies which consists the basic models and analytical techniques. All the way, this course walks you through the basic fundamentals of the stages in data science methodology.  ",5
971,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Prabhakaran E,"Jan 4, 2020","The course paints an overall picture on the complete set of steps that are followed while working on a Data science project. The best part are the exercises, where we are required to solve a problem to identify the cuisine of any recipe by using a decision tree algorithm. One thing which I found tough was that the python coding part was not explained even a bit. A brief information on the various functions and methods that are used as a part of exercise would be even more helpful. Other than that, its a great course for beginners.",5
972,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Ashok K,"Jan 7, 2019","Good course. Thanks to the instructors, IBM and Coursera for making this course available online. 
 One small thing I would like to request for the answer-input area for the final Peer-Graded assignment. is to provide mechanism to add images and or link as well. That can be very useful for anyone who want to add images of Decision-Tree or Data Model etc. in addition to text explanation to make it more clear.  The workaround to load images on Google-Drive and then copy-paste text-link in the answer-box was
okay as well, I guess !!

973,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Jeanne L M,"Apr 28, 2020","Best course for starters, really understood key concepts and how to apply them into labs and practice questions. Moreover, this platform really tested my core understanding through the intensity and volume of practice questions (which Cognitive Class only had 3 questions each per practice). Can't wait to get my Badge for this course! One thing is that we learners have to pay access for subscriptions in order to get our certifications and badges which the fees were not mentioned beforehand until before the check-out page.",5
974,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Jahanzeb A,"Nov 22, 2023","I recently completed the Data Science Methodology course on Coursera, and I must say it's nothing short of brilliant! The content is exceptionally well-structured, making complex concepts easy to grasp. The practical approach to real-world problem-solving scenarios greatly enhanced my understanding. The engaging delivery by the instructors, coupled with hands-on exercises, kept me motivated throughout. Overall, a fantastic learning experience that I highly recommend for anyone diving into the world of data science.",5
975,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Jianxu S,"Aug 25, 2019","I would probably give 4.5 stars if there is such choice. Overall, it is good and fun to work through the material but there are places where the message was not crystal clear. For examples, the analogy between data scientist and cook is not always helpful. One of the quiz question described model 2 but was associated with the wrong cost ratio (4:1 instead of 9:1). If Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve is an important concept then perhaps a little bit more explanation is warranted.",5
976,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Abhishek G,"Oct 2, 2020","This course is very special as it gives the practical knowledge of how does a data scientist think while doing his job. It teaches us to create different visions to see a single problem with a different mindset. The practical example of ""Congestive Heart Failure"", teaches the realistic thinking of a data scientist.
This course is the third part of the multi-series course of IBM and whatever I learned in the previous two courses, all those were implemented in this course.",5
977,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Mohammad A I,"Dec 10, 2022","I think methodology is the most important part. I've  been being experienced since my undergraduate level that any problem can be solved when it's methodology is clarified. Many of our teachers asked us of the method first,  then insisted to do. So, from this course arranged by 'Coursera', anyone having some story-telling capacity with some science-background including math, can learn a lot for solving today's business problems lie in marketing or other areas.",5
978,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Daniel F,"Jan 25, 2021","This course is incredibly important in my opinion as it really focuses on the methodology, and not technical aspects, forcing you to think like a data scientist and teaching you on how to approach business problems that can be solved by using data. This is a key course/lesson that is usually missing from other Data Science tutorials and courses, which tend to focus more on how to perform a certain step, and not show the great picture of what all the steps are.",5
979,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Sebastian K,"Nov 21, 2022","This course was really well designed. The explanation built around the hospital example and the external working tool (notebook) with the cuisine example was very helpful for understanding. 
Especially compared to the rather mediocre designed ""Tools for Data Science"" course this course was ingenious from a didactic point of view. I also very much appreciate that the external learning tools were jupyter notebooks and non of those dysfunctional IBM cloud tools!",5
980,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Oritseweyinmi H A,"Apr 2, 2020","I have previously dabbled in various parts of the full data science process. Including data collection, data understanding and data preparation. I have also separately worked on data modelling and data evaluation on Kaggle. However I am very grateful for this course, as it has enabled me to be able to appreciate the big picture view of data science and has provided me with a framework to use for future data science projects. Insightful and very comprehensive!",5
981,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Mickey M,"Aug 18, 2023","This course was very interesting. I had zero knowledge about methodology or the techniques used to solve problems. It was nice the course was structured around ""cooking"". The only problem I had were the videos were recorded a little low, so I needed to raise the volume on my computer to hear. There were some videos that did not have any close caption or the transcripts were in Turkish. Overall, a great way to learn about Data Science Methodology. Thank you.",5
982,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Vairavan P,"Jun 18, 2020",I loved this course. I am very new to data science and I was stuck on what is data science and how to start with data science. This course gave me a very good insight right from how to start analyzing the problem and what are the stepped to be followed in each and every stage. The main highlight of this course is they use a case study to explain what happens practically in each and every stage. It helps in properly understading the concepts ,5
983,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Kshanti G,"Jun 9, 2022","I enjoyed the content of this course and felt like it gave good examples and case studies. The assignments were helpful to get a feel for using Jupyter and python for data science, and the real world data set was useful.

I did not understand their differentiators for descriptive vs predictive approaches, and earlier in the course they had a third- classification- which seemed to have been merged into one of the two others later on. ",5
984,Data Science Methodology by IBM,K L K,"Oct 26, 2020","This course takes you through the mind of a data scientist. How a data scientist strategically thinks to solve a problem? The methodology of problem-solving will be embedded in your mind, more relevant to data science problems. How a data scientist should behave at various stages and how it can be effectively done, what are the alternatives, and what is mandatory? These questions are answered when you follow this course. Good one!",5

appreciate the helpful support you've given me, I am interested in Data
Science Methodology and this course helped me a lot to understand those
concepts in an easy and right way. In this course, I learned how to use the
data within the decision-making process, how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand, a methodology that can be used within data science.
Thank you once more for your help in this matter.",5
986,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Fabian E P C,"Oct 22, 2022","It is extremely important to have a methodological guide to help you establish the steps to follow to execute data science projects, most people want to dive head first into programming, cleaning data and building fancy machine learning models, but they don't know how relevant it is to have all the phases of the process clear. Don't be like the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, running without a clear goal.",5
987,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Diego R M V,"May 25, 2020",I really enjor it. Make me thing as different way in systematic but creative way. There are different ways to solve a problem based on the question we are getting. I know that we only cover some of them for trying not making the course that large. Would be wonderful to have optional resources beyond the course on how to attack different kind of questions as well as evaluating which kind approach use. ,5
988,Data Science Methodology by IBM,S M G A N,"Jul 3, 2023","The IBM Coursera course ""Data Science Methodology"" was a wonderful learning experience.

991,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Felipe T,"Sep 26, 2020",This course helped me get more familiarized with structuring an efficient methodology to use data science in different scenarios. Seeing data science as an iterative process that is always subject to improvements and recognizing how the different stages relate to others helps to understand that it is a process that never ends and provides an efficient solution to specific problems.,5
992,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Damilola O,"Apr 21, 2020","The Data Science Methodology really opened my mind to the meticulous process of 'solutioning' as a Data Scientist. Understanding Business Case and what the business owners want, dimensioning to know the approach analytics, knowing the data set to work with and how to analyse same, and ultimately modelling and also learning from the model via feedback so as to make things better.",5
993,Data Science Methodology by IBM,Eve B,"Jun 10, 2020","A quite good course, I like methodology and theory behind data science. I am glad the peer review is 10%, and the quizzes total 90%. I think this helps students to have objective standards and not be dependent on anonymous peer reviews.
Just a little point at the end: The example of the US health care system does not seem to be completely useful for students of other regions. ",5
994,Data Science Methodology by IBM,管正国,"Aug 17, 2021","Thank you very much for someone in the forum who can answer some simple questions. I have learned more skills of using Python and Jupyter Notebook in this course, which will benefit me a lot.

1030,A Crash Course in Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Sven M,"Sep 19, 2016","Executive Summary: Do not spend time on this course if you have minimal common sense and have read at least one article on Data Science.
I finished the 11 week course ""Machine Learning - Stanford University - by Andrew Ng"" 2 months ago, which was such a great course! It kept me busy for about 20 days (at about 4-6 hours per day) and I learned so much!
This course ""A Crash Course in Data Science - Johns Hopkins University"" , Part of a 5-course series, the Executive Data Science Specialization, provided just some superficial obvious information, took me only 3 hours to complete and even this time I would could wasted time.
Finally coursera now starts to make courses smaller and smaller and them adding multiple of them up to ""Specialization"", so that at the end you have to pay much more to get a certain amount of information and course time. With this course they seem to have streched it to a new extreme. The price for the certificate for this superficial short mini course has reached the same price ($ 44) as what I payed for the extensive great Machine Learning course from Stanford University by Andrew Ng !",1

1033,A Crash Course in Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Thomas W,"Dec 28, 2017","All the course content is too basic to bother with.  It’s just a bunch of common sense and a few definitions of vocabulary words that can already be found on Wikipedia.  There is typically one page of reading stating basic definitions and intuitive ideas followed by a 10-15 minute video reiterating those basic ideas. For example, there is an entire unit just to explain that a report on a data science experiment should be clearly written, avoid unnecessary detail, and have concise conclusions.  There is a page of reading to list these as bullet points and a 14 minute video to repeat these points.
This course is a waste of time.  Thankfully, it’s short and free.     ",1

The more you explore the resources and extra materials the more you will learn.  The instructors are well versed in the field and certainly have their hands full constructing software and analysis for what is quite possibly the number one research medical hospital/college in the country, Johns Hopkins.  Any certificate or credentials from this institution is indeed most valuable  and highly recommended.  The material can be a little dense since it is a ""crash course"", but if you retake your tests and use them as a review of the basic core components of each  lesson, you will get what it takes to get a team off the ground working on a real time project with  precise goals and applications.  Use the variable speed on the videos to slow the lectures down when needed.  A great introduction to the varying data sources you will use as a data scientist.",5
1048,A Crash Course in Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Kshitij G,"Feb 22, 2016","I think the course is apt to begin getting a feel of data science management and needs. I have realised during the course that it is a fairly complex discipline for a beginner with no exposure to statistics and the terminology.
Initially it might seem like over the top, but with some research and reading of suggested materials , one shall be able to get a hang of it in due time.
I also believe the instructors have had to work hard to make sure the upper level course can be delivered as close as possible to the level of a beginner.
My only suggestion is if they could add a list of sorts for statistical jargon , explained in layman terms, which would actually enable quicker absorbance.",5

1155,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",lkflrs,"May 1, 2019","I come from a background of teaching for 18 years, and not in SQL. My biggest criticism for this course is the lack of preparation for the culminating activities. The course saves all the challenging work for the last 2% of the course. Even that would be okay, if you were prepared via practice early on for the rigor at the end. All the assistants and fellow students try their best to help each other in the forums without cheating, but it shouldn't be this way. If so many students are needing so much help in the final part of the course, then that speaks to ineffective and inadequate instruction early in the course. 
Teaching is not just knowing the material or being engaging. The real work of an instructor is to create instruction that builds students' knowledge and prepares them for tasks in a logical, methodical progression. This course was like playing on the monkey bars and some light tumbling for 90% of the time, then suddenly being asked to stick a landing in the Olympics off the uneven bars. I exaggerate to make the point of my frustration.",2

-) Quiz and exam questions are poorly written; they are unclear and unhelpful.  
-) Quizzes and exercises are also far an few between. You need more frequent exercises. 
-) Nobody will answer your questions. But that's ok. You will still learn the fundamental concepts and you will pass the test. 
Overall, this course is good as a very first step in a safe and clean environment. If you want something in a more real environment (say, integrate with Python), you will need to take another course. ",3
1158,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Luca T,"Mar 18, 2019","The videos contain the material necessary to get a basic understanding for relational databases and sql. 
I ended up skipping a lot of parts in the videos because of the extremely slow pace. The lectures also feel very scripted as well as awkward and were not very enjoyable to watch.
The tests were mostly ok, sometimes the tasks were not possible to be solved with the knowledge learned or with the very limited sql-version available (sqlite). It sometimes felt like the creators did not solve them before submitting.
The final assignement is quite the mess. A lot of repetitive work, sometimes the questions plainly dont make a lot of sense. Eg: Is there a correlation between factor a and b? Show by looking at top 10 results for a... not very statistically meaningful!",2

The narration is awkward and appears to have been written by someone other than the narrator.
Some of the assignment questions are terribly worded and mentors have provided inconsistent clarification on how to deal with some of these cases.
Many legitimate concerns that have been raised in the forums have not even been acknowledged let alone addressed by staff/mentors.
Nevertheless, the course at the very least does provide a reasonable structure, and the graded quizzes/assignment motivate students to achieve a certain level of mastery.",2
1160,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",André A,"May 1, 2019","I dislike being negative about courses, but I really struggled on this one.  The lecture videos felt disconnected from the coursework, and it was often unclear what the lectures were supposed to be teaching me.  There was very little detail in the lectures themselves, but rather vague bulletpointed lists that the lecturer just read out verbatim.  
The assignments were too few and far between, and I seldom got the opportunity to try out the techniques that were mentioned in the lecturers for days or weeks, so when I did I often didn't understand what I was being tested on.  In many cases, I found I had to read up on W3 Schools instead to find the correct clauses and syntax.  Despite the supposed focus on SQLite, I don't feel we covered using SQLite in enough detail for me to say I would feel familiar with it vs any other environment.  
The forums were a long list of questions from confused students with little useful feedback, and the final assignment had questions that couldn't be answered literally, which made the peer-reviewed nature of the marking unpredictable.
I can't recommend this course as it currently stands.  ",2

1162,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Finn O,"Apr 6, 2019",Poorly designed quiz and final project questions combined with a SQL interface which cannot use some of the commands introduced in the lessons leads to tedious parsing of the questions.

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to finish the course at all considering the plethora of uncorrected problems plaguing the course. I recommend that this class be evaluated for quality assurance.
I am not the only student experiencing problems with this assignment. The forums for week 4 are teeming with unanswered questions regarding the assignment and its unclarity.

1164,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Chutian Z,"Jan 18, 2019","Pretty decent introductory course to SQL.
Pros: Quiz and coding assignments are good, overall speaking.
Cons: (1) The instructor usually spends lots of time laying out the learning objective and the background info. (2) Too few examples. (3) Too few coding tests. Ideally, put one quick test after each video for students to get their hands dirty as soon as possible rather than wait till the end of the module. (4) Provide summary pdfs which summarizes the syntax the module covers. (5) Provide answers to the coding questions.",4
1165,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Felipe F,"Jan 13, 2021","This course most definitely needs a revamp and an update on videos, content, exercises as well as more clearly stating what is expected from students. Honestly, I don't think the true grading is a one star, it would probably be between 2.5 and 3, but I believe that at this point if we don't give a terrible rating back, neither Coursera nor UC Davis and the faculty/staff serving this course will take action to improve it.  There is a lot to be criticized/updated.
I strongly recommend you read other reviews, going back to as long as 2 to 3 years in the past where these flaws are clearly outlined and appointed by former students, and yet in Jan 2021 they are all still there. In summary:
-videos are of hardly any help. The instructor (clearly a knowledgeable person) is hindered by having to read from a teleprompter. The text given to her is not what she would've said spontaneously, so more often that not we see her get caught between what she is thinking versus what she is reading to speak, and this causes confusion during explanation of some hard to grasp moments.
-slides are static and don't provide any significant help in making the hard content really easier to understand. In a course aiming at teaching a code language, we need dynamic video content, seeing the queries being written and the resulting output, and a demonstration of how a change in parameters results in a change of the output. 
-the sandbox environment for practice is extremely limited and gets in the way of allowing naive students to really understand some of the dat structure in the background. 
-the gap between theory and practice is gigantic, and the code assignments at the end of each module are light years away from what was taught. This is particularly painful with the last peer reviewed assignment, which would require at least one additional full week of time after the end of the 4 modules to give students a chance to understand the data, work with it and craft their answers. 
If you take this course, you will end up learning useful SQL content, but this will be at the cost of several additional hours spent googling results and support everywhere on the web. If googling was going to be our primary source of learning anyway, then what is the point of having the course in the first place? People enroll in course because they expect that the instructor, lessons and exercises will steer and help them through the initial learning before they are ready to move on their own, and this is exactly where this course fails. I came to the course already knowing other programming languages and with a good database and data background, so I could ""brute force my way through googling"", but I can only imagine what other less prepared students could feel. Your money is probably best spent elsewhere if you want to learn SQL (or even no money at all in some good websites on the net).",1

Some concepts were explained very poorly, and I'll have to supplement how parts of the basics are used (e.g. Views, Self Joins, Having, European Date treatment). Often the lecturer tripped over sentences inserting phrases that made no sense, couldn't read words on the screen correctly etc. Also, needed FAR more examples for a couple of the more involved commands. Syntax of code writing changed mid lecture series for one of the weeks, and the practice questions in W2 had completely inconsistent code with what was provided in lectures.

1182,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Melissa P,"Aug 20, 2021","This was the first Coursera course I took, and it'll probably be the last. I did learn some SQL basics, but there are a lot of issues with this course. 
-My biggest problem with this course (and Coursera) is plagiarism. You're randomly assigned to grade 3 peers' final assignments. I graded the first and second assignments, and on the third realized that it was an exact duplicate of the first. I reported the third for plagiarism, but I couldn't go back and report the first one, so that person just got a good grade for a 100% plagiarized assignment. If I hadn't been randomly assigned those two people, I wouldn't have known the assignments were copied. Coursera clearly doesn't have even the most basic automatic plagiarism checker set up, which would've caught exact duplicates. If the only way to identify and report plagiarism is for a student to get randomly assigned 2-3 assignments that happened to be duplicates, realize it, and report it, there's a major problem. This completely devalues the certificate.
Now on to other issues:
-As other reviewers have mentioned, the final assignment is a big jump from the work up to that point, and there aren't enough smaller assignments to test out skills. Lots of things that are mentioned in the lectures aren't included in the assignments, so you don't get to practice.
-There are a ton of posts in the discussion forums mentioning various problems with course material, like typos or confusingly worded assignments--these posts go back as far as 4 years, and the same problems are still in the materials. Even easy fixes like typos in assignments haven't been addressed.
-The moderators/course assistants/Coursera staff sometimes reply to questions in the forum, but it's rare, and the posts they reply to seem random. The forums are also flooded with 4+ years of sometimes pointless posts, so it's basically impossible to find anything relevant to whatever question you have.
-Many of the (automatically graded) assignments don't have examples of the correct code in the feedback, so if you get something wrong, you'll have no idea what you should be doing instead. The lectures don't come close to providing enough information to complete assignments, either.
-The rubric for the peer-graded final assignment is a mess. On some questions, the grader is asked if the code ""looks correct."" Well, maybe? I know that there are usually multiple ways to get an answer with coding, but there aren't any examples of what a correct answer looks like. If I got one of the questions wrong, there would be no feedback to help me figure out where I went wrong. Some questions have the option to give a grade of zero if the person left the question blank, but not all--so you could leave a question completely blank and still get points because there's no other option. 
-One of the questions on the final assignment asks students to look at two columns of data and report whether they think there's a correlation. You can't do that. It's a ridiculous question. Especially because you can only see 10 rows of data at a time. And the course designer knows that, because the rubric says you get full points for attempting to answer the question--""It doesn't matter whether the interpretation appears to make sense based on the data or not."" Why does this question even exist?
I had some other issues, but this has been a lot of typing and I'm pretty sure I'm yelling into the void anyway. TL;DR: don't take this course, and it's probably a good idea to avoid Coursera generally.",1

1187,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Steve C,"Feb 23, 2021","I originally wrote this review about halfway through the course and gave it 2 stars, but I just got to the final project and am amending it to be 1 star. My reasoning for one star is as follows:
1) The instruction is often difficult to follow. The instructor will narrate with a snippet of code and a table or set of tables on the screen, but there won't be any visual aid to help follow along, as the slides are static. She also frequently stumbles over herself while reading from her teleprompter, so the combination of the static slides and her directionless cadence makes it very hard to keep track of what is going on.
2)  The evaluations are split into two types, one of which is informational, one of which is coding. The questions of the former type very rarely reflect any sort of understanding and are more about rote regurgitation of information found on the (poorly formatted) slides. After taking a quiz or two, you come to realize that virtually any time a list is written on the screen, you had better write down every item on that list because there will be a ""select all that apply"" question at the end. Sometimes writing it all down doesn't even work, as she doesn't take care to make sure her headers and data match up. A parallel to the kinds of lists she often uses would be:
Types of Vegetables
1. Celery, 2. Cauliflower, 3. Vitamin C is good!, 4. Carrots, 5. Make sure to eat your vegetables! 
The subject she is teaching revolves entirely around key-value pairs, and her slides don't reflect any sort of understanding of that relationship. If that table only accepted ""vegetable"" as a data type, she would get an error.
  3) The coding evaluations, on the other hand, are extremely difficult as they extend the information well beyond what was taught in the preceding lecture, and almost no time is given to allow you to explore how the code works. The course thrusts you into a situation where you're writing code in a language with which you have almost no familiarity (and SQL has pretty poor error handling, and no custom error handling is written to help you understand where you went wrong). I strongly, strongly recommend Coursera learners take another class or use some other tool to learn SQL. I used a free instructional tool and felt so much more competent after 10 minutes of messing around on it than I did after watching an hour of lecture.
4) The material is often presented as her opinion rather than factual information that should be learned. I've taken a number of courses on Coursera, and they've been treated professionally, where information delivered was generally factual. If the professor wanted to inject opinion, it would be made clear it was opinion, and an evaluation may read, ""Which of these may make x easier"" or something like that. This instructor will phrase things like, ""What did I say was the most important thing to know..."" which just seems unprofessional. EDIT: Another example in response to a correct quiz answer was ""You're not actually writing the query to the database or anything. What you're doing is you're just kind of storing it for the time being.""
Look at that last sentence.
I could go on, but all in all, this course didn't even begin to resemble the level of professionalism or quality I've seen in other courses on Coursera. It reminds me of being peer taught during my education degree, full of teaching methods and lacking instructional skill. However, it's the only one that popped up as a beginner's course on SQL, so I finished it out. I regret doing so.",1

1192,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Omer G,"Jul 2, 2018","While I did learn some useful bits, I found the course lacking. I think it could have been much improved if certain conditions would have been met:A. More practice! You don't learn a computer language by hearing about it, you learn by using it. The only practice this course had were the quizzes, and they were far from sufficient. I would expect each lesson to be followed by at least some practice. I often found myself venturing to different websites in order to practice what I had learned, and learned more from that than I did from the actual course.B. Better explanations. I found the explanations short and sometimes lacking. Moreover, at times there was no synchronization between what the instructor was saying and what was presented on screen (e.g. she was talking about products when the example presented data of employess). It's a small thing but can be very confusing. It is very important to be precise here. Again, I found myself reading elsewhere in order to better understand certain concepts, which I might as well have learned elsewhere altogether.C. Examples! Again, you don't learn a computer language by hearing about it. You learn by using it or by seeing how it is used. Whenever I'm taught something, I want to be shown examples of possible ways to use it. Examples were scarce and incomprehensive.D. Applicability. The course is called ""SQL for Data Science"", yet I found very little in the way of applying SQL to data science. I would expect a lot more tips and tricks and examples of real-life problems and how an actual data scientist would tackle them. There was almost none of that. There were positives as well.

The assessments and final project were the most disappointing part, however. The Yelp dataset was error-prone and incomplete which totally tarnished the final exercise. Questions were confusing and misleading, and the only saving grace were the wonderful community forums where users helped each other to troubleshoot all the sloppy mistakes in the dataset and wording of questions. Worst of all, these posts/errors are 3-4 years old and UC Davis has done nothing to remedy as of December 2021. It feels as if this course has had zero attention since initially being published and is riddled with confusing errors and dead-ends that are extremely frustrating for someone to learn a new programming language.

Sometimes the course misses to explaing relevant detail.

But now, I sense the need to change it and add to it. Yes, I have actually changed the final rating from three stars to only one star. (Below is a quick review, because I don't want to waste too much time on it.)
In the beginning, it was claimed that certain participation in some so-called ""discussion"" was optional, but you had to participate in order to even be allowed to move on with the course. So the claim was false, and no one cared to take care of it. Or if the claim was indeed true, then indeed you did not have to participate, and it was indeed optional, and of course in that case you would not be allowed to move on. Either way, this immediately created a ""bad taste"" so to speak.
There seemed to be errors or sloppiness in the quiz questions and in some of the sets of multiple choice answers, which was annoying. Some quiz questions were not very clearly put, so sometimes -- I would even say often -- it was difficult to understand the question. Sometimes it also seemed as though some of the quiz code questions suddenly went too far compared to the material taught, which is in part due to the course's lack of practice.
The instruction videos were also poor, because they were not very well optimized. For example, the instructor's audio had a lot of ""wet sounds"" in it, so to speak. Also, the instructor's teaching was unpleasant to listen to, because it sounded awkward, as though overly scripted or very unnatural. There were also errors where some word or name did not match with code on-screen. Maybe she is a good instructor outside of Coursera, but you could not tell by these videos. Sometimes, the audio was even cut off, or so it seemed.
Because of the earlier mentioned lack of practice from the course, you must do a lot of practice yourself. I already knew some things here and there, and usually find my way around computers, and so on, anyway, so sometimes I had an easier time. I also understood some of the statistical concepts they asked about later on.
But even if so, I decided to quit during the final assignment, because 
(1) in the beginning of the final assignment (or rather right before it) it was unclear how to proceed on Coursera itself about it, and I wasted time finding out; 
(2) because of the course's sloppiness, it looked as though, after using only SQLite in the course, you suddenly had to use MySQL in Coursera's online sandbox (which may not have been a big deal, but is still strange a choice for a course), but really you had to enter some link and use the online SQLite interface with the Yelp dataset, which I only found out after roaming the so-called ""discussion"" fora for some time, wasting time in doing so;
(3) the assignment itself had questions that should not even be asked, because some of the (statistical) topics were not even covered in the course, and, again, there had hardly been any practice in the course itself to prepare you, making it an even poorer course.
I read some of the other reviews, especially the ones criticizing the course. Overall, relatively there are not that many giving low ratings, but they are right: it really is a poor course. I don't understand why the course has such a high score.
In short, it is a poor course, no one cares to update it properly, and I would recommend to any other course taker to get the most out of it, preferably for free, and then to leave as quickly as possible. ",1
1222,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Norman S P,"Jul 12, 2021","The best thing I can say is that the deadlines motivated me to complete my week's studies.
Unfortunately the instructor, content and presentation were really poor for this course.
The quality here really serves as a stain (in my eyes) on the reputation of UC Davis and Coursera.
The instructor continually stumbled over her words as she read whatever teleprompter she was reading from during the presentations. It appears she didnt write the presentation herself as she stumbled through her presentations often creating wordy non-sensical explanations. It appears she never practiced the monologue before filming.
In addition there were many mistakes in the code in the powerpoint presentations. This course has been around for many years with hundreds of thousands of students. You'd think that by now they may have decided they should re-film the course and correct the simple and blatant errors that any complete beginner can see clearly in the presentations.
Otherwise, it's an ok course if you want to use it as a starting point to your self-teaching. I would recommend anyone taking this course to study with other materials on the side as well in order to truly become proficient and to help them know the subject matter better than the instructor who clearly is no expert due to the many and simple mistakes she propagates through her course.",1
1223,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Katherine N,"Feb 19, 2022","This was the first course I ever took on Coursera and I honestly wondered if they were all like this and how Coursera was able to stay in business.  I stopped halfway through for a variety of reasons.  The instructor was incredibly awkward on camera and just read a teleprompter the entire time.  I ended up doing some other courses (by other instructors) and realized how many basic pieces of information she had left out. There was very little hands-on practice throughout the course and the quizzes wouldn't even show you the correct coding if you got it wrong, so you weren't able to learn what you did wrong. Glad that I have found some other courses to take on this subject, but I'll be avoiding this teacher/school from now on.",1
1224,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",christian s,"Apr 12, 2022","This is not a beginner course, it is very high level with little time or explanations spent on each topic.  The quizes  expect syntax that has not been gone over in order to correctly answer the questions.  I received better explantions for what was needed from W3school brief high level explanaton then I did this ocurse.   
The instructor tends to stumble over her words alot which causes confusion and the examples within the presentation are not really clear as they arent based off real world, just table 1 table 2 etc. 
I debated if I should review or not as I wonder also is this just not witin my leanring style, but reallized in a course of this type it should fit a variety learning styles as the Google courses do.  ",1

Most of the time the task is not clear, there are no example to guide you and the material given in the lectures are most of the time totally useless. I felt very frustrated. Not a completely waste of time, but I would never recommend this course to anyone.  I really wanted to learn something, but everything was against it.

1233,"SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis",Шайдуллин А,"Aug 3, 2020","In general, the course is not bad, but there are a number of disadvantages, ranging from minor to serious omissions. I wanted to give the course 3 stars, but the last homework was quite fun and productive (you can put 4.5, according to the rules of mathematics, round to 5, but with a very large advance). The basic skills were acquired during the last assignment.
 First, about the benefits of the course: 
 1+ In the course, you can practice on real data without using other software, it is really useful and productive; 
2+ Theoretical aspects are more than enough; 
3+ Theoretical tests correspond to the lecture materials. 
 Now to the disadvantages (there are still more of them), first to the serious ones: 
 1- There is a lot of so-called ""Water"", information that is completely unimportant and purely theoretical. Almost the entire first week was devoted to theory (""Why is this subject important? Separation of duties among employees, etc.). I think the course would have done well without these materials. Often, one fourth of the length of each video is an explanation of what we will be studying today. I think , the student wants to quickly learn important material for him. 
 2- The first 2 weeks of coding looks very good, easy to understand and solve for yourself. But something strange happened on week 3, the tasks became much more complicated, they did not correspond to the lecture materials, where theoretical material was mainly given. Week 4 has already been done normally. Probably, without prompts (sometimes direct), I could not have done these tasks. It was very difficult! 
 3- The course is rather short (only 4 weeks), little time is devoted to programming, there is not enough practice, maybe it was even worth adding a small invaluable practice after each video. 
 4- The lecturer tried to convey the idea that the usual repetition of programming steps may be ineffective. Unfortunately, today, nothing is better than ""I copy after the lecturer, who explains something in parallel, and then independently practice it on real data."" The lecturer's methodology was not the most effective; nevertheless, after completing the course, many questions remain. 
 Minor disadvantages: 
 - For the convenience of work, you can download the presentation of the lecture, but I think it is convenient for some students to print these lectures and work. Unfortunately, the design and background were chosen in a dark color, which is why the material after printing is inconvenient to read (-a lot of paint is wasted), it is rather difficult to correct it yourself. 
 - The material chosen for reading by the lecturer is slightly robotic, it is convenient to set at a speed of 1.25 or 1.5. 
 In any case, I was able to familiarize myself with this programming language, I was able to learn something. I think one day it will suit me. At the moment, I still prefer to work in Python and other programs. I was still able to get a certificate of completion of the course. Thanks for the course and thanks for your attention to this long comment! Hope it helps you get better! Good luck :)",5

I found the course actually challenging, which on one hand was fantastic, but the monotone, stepping over every sentence, and flavorless videos ran by the same instructor, made this class very indigestible. 

Truly, I feel horrible for any non-English speakers who had to handle this course as first time learners. I'd be scratching my head, or running for the hills. I know the University of California has enough time, energy, and funds to put a good course together - so I'd lightly give this recommendation: find a speaker for your videos who can show emotion, deliver a speech, and knows how to teach a point. Maybe one that doesn't sound like they are reading from a teleprompter, and can deliver punctuation. It felt like one long sentence every video, no breaths taken. You made this course unnecessarily difficult with the speaker alone. Going right into the modules / quizzes that require specifically tailored, distinctly created queries done all by the user - you need to balance this course with at least an easy to understand instructor. This was not the case and I honestly wish I'd known that prior to signing up.  ",2

Also the questioning in the case study is very unclear - watching the discussion forum I'm not the only one who struggled to understand what they want.

I found learning the language fairly straightforward, especially because many SQL-type commands are built into R packages (like dplyr). My job has a comprehensive relational database but, I usually use a point and click interface to make queries- now that I'm more proficient I'll start using SQL though. Additionally, I was hoping to pick up SQL before starting my grad program in analytics so I can ""hit the ground running"" and be ready for classes focused on database management and data engineering. I was able to accomplish this without any question.
I really liked the course, which is not surprising given all of Coursera's data science content is excellent.

1280,Data Science Ethics by University of Michigan,Aaron Z,"Feb 18, 2018","This couse presented some interesting case studies, but never presented a real ethical system.  In particular, the instructor frequently equated ethical behavior with socially acceptable behavior (this activity by corporation x was unethical because it resulted in public outcry).  Someone with a background in ethics really should have been consulted in course developement.  
On a  purely practical matter, the ta did not seem to have any training in ethics at all.  He just responded to every comment in the discussion area with a ""what about"" statement that sounded like it came straight from a late night dorm room bs session.  ",2
1281,Data Science Ethics by University of Michigan,Daithi M W,"Mar 25, 2018","I've been disappointed with the course overall. it's a very interesting topic, one that's relevant to the times we live in. But I feel that many of the big questions are neither asked nor answered in the course. 
The presenter's background is in engineering, not philosophy. This isn't a fundamental problem in itself, but it does mean that concepts are left very vaguely defined. So 'ethics' is, at one point, defined more or less as 'what's socially agreed-up'. But in the questions as well as the videos, the terminology shifts between 'ethically right/wrong', 'appropriate', 'have to do something,' 'by rights', 'legally', and lots more besides. So it's far from clear what the right or wrong position might be in many of the thought-experiments described in the quiz questions. What's more, if an action isn't in itself ethically right, that doesn't entail that it must be ethically wrong: it could be neither. There's virtually no input from other voices, too: no discussions with, say, experts in the field of data ethics, or moral philosophers, or whatever. 
At one point in week 1, the presenter correctly points out that ''data ownership is really complex''. So it'd be useful to have a MOOC that makes it less complex: that asks hard questions, and critically examines the range of possible answers. Unfortunately, this MOOC isn't it. ",2

This one-star review is not for the content or presentation or quizzes, which are otherwise five-star, but for the simple fact that the evidenciary certificate that so many of us came here to get is locked behind a poorly planned and ironically unethical peer review system that was clearly not thought out before it was implemented.",1

As someone who has studied the philosophy of ethics (even if you've only taken one course in it) you'll likely be disappointed in the limited level of depth in terms of considering ethical theories. To be fair, the instructor does state this at the beginning of the course. My other issue I had with this course is that the assessment quizzes use true or false questions - which in my opinion represents a VAST simplification of the complexities of ethical questions. This kind of simplified black and white thinking is exactly what we do NOT want in the people creating and controlling our technology, so I was disappointed to see the assessment style encouraging it.",4

The course covered a range of topics related to data science ethics, including privacy, bias, transparency, and accountability. The instructors provided real-world examples and case studies to illustrate these concepts and help us understand their implications in practice.
One of the things I appreciated most about this course was the emphasis on actionable steps that data scientists can take to promote ethical practices in their work. The course provided practical tools and frameworks for identifying and mitigating ethical risks, which I found very useful.
Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone working in data science or related fields. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, this course will provide valuable insights and best practices for navigating the complex ethical considerations of the field.

1405,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Александр Д,"Oct 18, 2018","Very low quality of the course. The structure of the course is illogical. Also it takes too little effort to accomplish the course. In the beginning  of th course labs contain all the code so a pupil doesn't have to do his/her best to solve tasks. I can just constantly press ctrl+enter and get my certificates. It is not what I expected from the course. Also quizes never contain  coding practice, so to accomplish I just need to show the understanding of the basic aspects of the topic, not the coding skills. The, at the end of the course (after I have lost all the motivation during the first weeks you give us difficult function, including custom functions, never explaining them at all). Have a huge doubt about buying the subscribe for the next month.",2

1408,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Laura M,"Jun 26, 2019","Honestly, I'm not sure why this course has such a high rating. I feel like it can't possibly be a reflection of what actual students felt about the course. Reading the other reviews, it's clear some of the issues people had with the course were not the course-designers fault. But,  there were some tissues that are simply inexcusable. For example, typos in the lectures (especially towards the final week) show little to no proofreading was done. A lot of the labs involved ""Warnings"" that the instructors didn't explain to students (and so obviously some students got confused by them, even though they were inconsequential). And the final peer-graded assignment was a complete mess. The first few questions are numbered Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, etc. But the last 4-5 questions are not numbered making it very annoying to upload screenshots for each question. The directions in the assignment were simply wrong. For example, one of the questions didn't even have a prompt, just an empty text box. Someone asked about it in the ""Discussions"" and a staff member replied but it was never fixed in the assignment.  
Trying to put the typos and logistical confusion aside, the course material was oddly organized and students were never really given an explanation as to why the concepts taught were being taught in this way. My least enjoyed course of the whole specialization. ",1
1409,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Amy P,"May 20, 2019","I am working through the IBM Data Science Certificate courses (in order) and this is easily the best one I have taken so far. Once again, the labs provide a variety of hands-on exercises that help to cement the topics introduced in the lectures (which, to be fair, are very fast-paced). Everything taught is practical and relevant. One request would be to fix the pacing of the videos and lecture quizzes, which often appear to test students' comprehension mere seconds after the topic was discussed! I did also notice a few errors in the labs, but they did not stop me from learning the material. Overall, great course.",5

Then, there is no logical continuity in the subjects presented. The course is supposed to be intended for beginners, however, there is no background information or reasoning behind what is presented. Many times, one may only copy and paste python commands without knowing why or what it means at all! Unfortunately, This course is a disaster, and hence, NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",1

1431,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Hakki K,"Jul 9, 2020","Hi,
I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.

1432,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Vera,"Apr 8, 2021","The general course content was okay. Unfortunately I didn't learn too much about Python and Data Analysis for Data Scientists. This was due to the following reasons:
1) a lot of interaction with not working IBM infrastructure. It took me around 3x as much time to get required things working on IBM cloud and IBM Watson compared to the time spent for actual assessments. It is annoying if it's getting that obvious that IBM wants to use the course to promote own products. This is sad as we all already pay for the course...
2) There occurred quiet some arrows in the labs which even after months (according to the discussion) have to been corrected.
3) The amount of hands-on training in the notebooks/labs was really small. It was not a lot one had to program on their own and the parts which had to be programmed were only an exact copy of what was already done before. Even the final assessment did not really contain a real task.
4) Many concepts weren't explained in depth. The explanations just stayed very superficial. Some concepts like fit()/fit_transform() which appeared in the labs weren't explained at all in the videos or in the labs. This led to a lot of confusion as could be seen in the discussion threads.
As we all pay for this course please increase the amount of actually explaining concepts in depth and the amount of real in depth hands-on training and reduce the parts on IBM Watson and other such stuff. Thanks a lot!",1
1433,Data Analysis with Python by IBM,Javier M,"Apr 28, 2021","The content is solid. However, the labs which are the best tools of this course because they allow you to actually do the exercises and go deeper in the concepts are not working. It has been like that for some weeks.
I contacted support and I saw in the course forum lots of people complaining about it but either Coursera or IBM don't seem to care. No answer from them for weeks. I had to dig into forums in the Internet to find alternative solutions to access the labs... which was a waste of time considering that I'm not auditing but paying for this course.

That said, there were problems:
1) The meta parameter, Alfa (or is is Alpha) is never explained, except that it helps.  To be useful, the student needs to know a bit more.  Also, the spelling should be consistent between the training texts and the lab.
2) The lab needs maintenance to keep up with changes in the Python packages.  I received warnings about using deprecated functions and values.

Lot's of syntax that you won't remember unless you are already familiar with it, (often intrusive) quizzes on syntax that you've only just seen (sometimes for only seconds), important themes and ideas lost in the implementation details, covering too much material at a superficial level instead of less material and actually learning it, skipping over the necessary mathematical/statistical background in order to quickly advance to blindly coding, skipping over the broader understanding of the (multitude of) libraries that were used in order to go right to using them, and meaningless labs that give the illusion of deep understanding but are in fact cut-and-paste fests devoid of understanding. I'd rather have taken a slower course in just pandas and a separate course in the linear algebra and statistics being used (with some math pre-requisites). I was also recommended this course immediately after finishing part 2 of introduction to python and I don't feel like I have nearly the python background that this class assumes, however I guess flaws in recommendations are not necessarily flaws in this course (unless it purports to be perfect for python novices).",1

In weeks 4 & 5 there were a couple of times when she named one function and the slide showed a different one.  When one is still low on the learning curve it is very important that the consistency of the material is solid.

A great example of the lack of understanding or knowledge of how Coursera works is something you can view yourself. 
Week 6 is the Final Project
Week 7 is one statement about your certificate. 
Usually in most courses, the final project will be in end of the final week. That week having multiple modules that you have to complete leading up to the final. It was worrying for me as I thought the approach to this was on accident, but it seems likely that it was just due to ignorance. 
Just as well, the Final Project was botched, the software and questions were depreciated and even written wrong by the creator. And when you would upload your pictures in the end to show you had worked out the problem, one of the upload buttons was missing in lieu of the letter ""Y""....

The topics were loose which meant issues encountered in data collection via scraping or visualization might not have been covered within the course.

I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete  
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete    
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete  
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete  
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete  
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete   
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete   
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete   
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours  (=169/9) to complete.

I am genuinely unsure whether you consider it important to use the Seattle accident data, or whether I can use some other kind of data and solve an unrelated problem.  The ""good"" example provided for the last week is something completely unrelated.  If I choose something unrelated, too, do I have to risk a bad grade from my peers who don't understand it?

1568,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Ozgur U,"Jul 3, 2020","I finished all he 9 courses in this specialisation. Therefore, this comment basically applies most of the 9 courses. 
The video contents and the practice exercises are very good and on point. Instructors are great. However, there are serious problems with the assessment mechanism and this is the reason why I am giving a 4 start.
If you work hard on the assignments, meaning that you study and research well to understand the code, you might end up getting a low score on assignments. This is because of peer-graded assignments. Your work might be graded by someone who doesn't understand the material as much as you do, or even someone who submitted a blank file just to see others' work. You rarely get feedback for the missing marks. As a simple example, I once submitted my work and received 4/11 with no feedback. I instantly re-submitted the same work and received 9/11 from another peer. 
Another problem is that you get to see the rubric only after you submit. Some assignments are not clear on what the specific expectations are. The rubric must be clear before you submit the work. Even if you try to be flexible in your solution to address the vagueness, the peers may not show the same flexibility although you do the work properly.
And finally, the biggest issue.. Plagiarism! When I say plagiarism here, I mean copying someone else's work line by line all the way. It is utterly disgusting that it is more widespread than I initially thought. Such cases have been posted multiple times in the forum. I encountered at least 2 cases of plagiarism. The only thing you can do is to flag the submission, but obviously this doesn't stop anyone. What's worse is that those people who plagiarised someone else's work line by line get to peer-grade your own work.  
Assessment section of these courses is a mess and has to be seriously re-evaluated. Peer graded assignments can be accepted to a certain extend but not for assignments that require hours and hours of our effort.",4

1585,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Song N W,"Apr 3, 2022","My review after around 11 or 12 months of studying all ten courses is: the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate contains general information and process on data science, but does not go into great detail. After joining the course, I was able to further think and ask at work how data collection would affect our product and indicate how the envisioned data may provide misleading information. However, the courses' duration is much longer than indicated on Coursera and apart from the time spent on completing the course contents, I have spent a lot of time trying to get Watson Studio or the hands-on lab operational, and the hands-on lab could be down for a week or more. From my perspective, this is counterintuitive and inefficient, and I did not expect this from IBM's products. 
Looking at some of the reviews for this course, I think it is fair to warn others who are looking to join that the courses are generic and some - if not most of the - time requires the learner to Google answers for any confusion and code tutorial or read books; this does not bother me as it has been my approach for a long time.
 
As I am writing this review I am awaiting my classmate to review my peer assignment for the second time because I got less than the required pass grade, which perhaps my classmates may have experienced once or twice throughout these ten courses due to incorrectly marked assignments. Although I admit I did not perfectly complete the capstone project's slides, based on the guide I would have received a higher score than what I had; for example, I got zero points instead of two points for having my GitHub link and PDF file attached. However, I understand the importance of reading your peer's assignments because some of the assignments I read inspired me, but the peer-review system is flawed because the course expects a constant number of students studying at the same period and the minimum number of assignments required the students to review would cover the whole cohort for that period; evidently, sometimes this system does not operate as expected because there are usually threads asking for help to review the assignment on the week's discussion forum.
Consequently, from my perspective, this course would be more efficient if an automated correction system was also available, similar to ""Machine Learning by Andrew Ng"".  ",3
1586,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Pradyumna V M,"Oct 31, 2021","The topic is so far away from what we normally face in the business world that I found it irrelevant. Also, the whole course material (entire Data Science Professional Cert program) needs to be ''audited"" for correctness, for example some quiz answers are wrong (therefore when you click the right answer, you get marked wrong), then there are instances of lack of guidance or misguidance in certain lab assignments, leading to hours of wasted time until you figure it out. Anyway it facilitates learning, albeit in a time-intensive way.  Lastly, in case you need to quickly contact some instructor to point out anything, it's totally hopeless. Just give up. They make sure you cannot get in touch with a human being live.  On the other hand, the course is organized well in terms of topic by topic development; a lot of effort has gone into creating the videos etc. I learned a lot and am happy with what I learned.",3
1587,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Sobhan A,"May 6, 2020","I can say overall it's a good program. However by reviewing the first few courses, you will get a headache, but the rest courses are very useful. Some parts are really useless for a data scientist and are more useful for programmers, which I recommend you do not put a lot of time on them and skip them as much as you can. 
Apart from the material, I think this certificate is really useful for you to get a job. But, if you just want to learn new concepts in data science and do not need a certificate, I recommend you to take other courses other than IBM. There are very good courses on @linkedin Learning. 
In this program, IBM pushes you to work only on its platforms which is really annoying and I think this a considerable drawback of this program. 
If you spend at least 4-5 hours a day, you'll be able to complete it in 2 months. The subscription is monthly and it's around $50 CAD and you can unsubscribe whenever you want. ",2

Why link each previous project individually, and then collectively? Why have a link in a slideshow? Who on earth thought 40+ slides was at all realistic? That's roughly 4x longer than what would be considered a max number of slides in any professional context! 
The amount of redundancy, busywork, and general disrespect toward the individual's time is absolutely attrocious. The several different ""activities"" that tell you how to make a POWERPOINT are downright insulting.

As it's been some time since I took other Data Science courses and tried to complete this one, I came back now, after around a year, to see if anything got fixed as I believe other participants of the course had problems creating their projects as well, yet however, I see that nothing has changed.

The only assistance you'll find is two to three year old forum posts, unanswered, from students who had to overcome the same errors with strange workarounds. Not to mention, the instructions are abysmal. It's almost as if the creators of this course have never actually had a homework assignment, and simply don't know how to compose a homework assignment, or they didn't take the time to actually do it themselves.

The course material and instructors were excellent, and the Jupyter Notebooks were very challenging at times - at least for someone who had left programming around 15-years ago.
The specialization, as it says, is of beginner level but would definitely equip the students to move forward on their own in their quest for data science.

1626,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Angelo G,"Aug 31, 2023","Very challenging course, much more challenging than the previous IBM Data Science courses. Although all of the topics that become relevant in the Capstone project have been addressed in previous courses it almost feels as if you have learned nothing before. So you HAVE to go back to the old courses. More often than not you realize that before you had only a superficial understanding of the concepts and the details. On the other hand, it also shows that some of the previous courses just were not good enough to have a lasting impact. This is especially true for the ""Data Visualisation"" course (and here in particular the Dashboard topic).
So while in the end it was a good learning experience to go through the pain of going back and forth between the project and old courses (or other sources), I would have wished that there is a more seamless flow within the whole IBM Data Science course.
Creating a 50 page final Report  is quite a challenge but it certainly helped to tie everything together. In the end, it was worth it and I am actually somewhat proud that I worked my way through it.
With all the critical points I mentioned I don't want to miss the opportunity to thank all instructors for setting up this course. I can imagine that this itself is a Herculean task, with all the technical hurdles that needed to be overcome. While there were a few hiccups that were only addressed in the discussion forum,  from a technical perspective, I think this course actually worked quite well.

1627,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Jon R,"Jul 12, 2023","The whole course desperately needs a proof read. There are sections where sentences don't make any sense. The scripting and dialogue can  be really clunky as well - phrases are repeated over and over . There are also parts where the exam section or final coursework has been updated with new content but the rest of the course has not been.  For example one section you are asked to construct a pie chart the help links it gives you are for a bar chart.  The videos are much more of an introduction and the real practice takes place in work sheets. I would like to see more videos explaining the processes in the worksheets as well as intro videos. Also Watson is pointless you make us sign up for a free account but nothing is really done with the programme, it is all jupiter or dash. Make everything in Watson or take the whole thing out. 
However, there is a lot of information in the work sheets and it is a good starting point for Data Science. The writers are clearly passionate about Data Science and that comes through in the course. It gives you a very good start point for a career in Data Science.",3

It would be very helpful if more data sources are explicitly provided to allow also ML projects with supervised learning.

1651,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Paul A,"Sep 25, 2020","When I first started this capstone, it felt a bit disjointed compared with the rest of the courses. But after really biting into it, I realized the content makes sense: it allowed me to put to the test what I learned on the course. Being constrained to use the Foursquare API on the capstone feels a bit odd, but at the end using an API to get information works really well. I tried scrapping the information my self and the workload I put on my self became significant. 
The only new machine learning tool introduced for this final part is K-means clustering, it's the most abstract concept on the entire specialization and I think it's the only one that could have been presented somewhat better. What I noticed while reviewing my peers is that for the assignments  everyone (me included) would just copy the k-means clustering algorithm and repeat the same analysis used on the labs. Which is kind of a shame, I just wish K-means clustering could have been developed better, beyond copy-paste.
At then end it's you; the person taking this specialization, the one who decides how much work you're going to put into this.",5
1652,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Sagiraju S D,"Mar 12, 2023","This is a fantastic course for students to learn from scratch what is Data Science about?

1654,Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM,Marius-Liviu B,"Dec 29, 2021","A tough course! I'm not a 9 to 5 Data Scientist so I need to made a lot of research in order to finish the project. But in the end it deserved it. I've learn a lot of things: technologies, libraries and concepts. Even my current job is PHP Developer I was amayzed how many tools from my current domain activity I can use on Data Science (Git, programming, SQL, Web scraping, Office suite tools). It was a well spent time and looking back on the overall experience for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate my one word conclusion is: ""professionalism"".  And the second word that defines IBM since I hear about it is ""innovation"".",5
1655,Excel Basics for Data Analysis by IBM,Steve C,"Nov 11, 2020","There are problems with the peer-reviewed project grading rubrics.  Other learners who, of course, are not subject experts do not always grade properly - sometimes completely wrong.  Although you can send a message to your peer reviewer, I have never received a follow-up explanation or response.  There is no practical recourse to appeal the unfairly peer graded assignment, other than to re-do and re-submit the assignment - which is time consuming and wasteful!  I think there needs to be a robust process in place to have subject experts, such as the course instructors, to review disputed peer reviewed and graded assignments.  Not once have I received a response from the Help Desk when I have reported a problem - this, too, is a big disappointment!",3

1657,Excel Basics for Data Analysis by IBM,Maria,"Oct 21, 2020",The course in general is very good and I recommend it. The only thing I think that could be better is a warning for students with Mac and those who don't have Excel's full version: some of the shortcuts and functions mencioned on the lessons needed for practical exercises will not work/be available. I had to work simultaneous with Web Excel and Googlesheets and constantly google other alternatives to accomplish the tasks.,3
1658,Excel Basics for Data Analysis by IBM,Emily G D,"Nov 30, 2020","I learned a lot of Excel fundamentals from the course. However, in my experience, having access to an instructor or classmates would have been helpful. For the final assignment, be sure you’re downloading the correct data sets. The first time, I downloaded the data sets from the provided original source link. However, the correct data sets are from other provided links. I was so confused when the directions were out-of-sync with my data sets. Had to redo the assignment using the correct data sets! Good content in course videos, although some of it pertains to older versions of Excel and does not match the interface and functions of Excel 2020. 3 Stars due to lack of clarity in assignment instructions, outdated material, minimal access to classmates, and no access to an instructor.

It made me learn many things about excel and its usage in various aspects of data analysis. Only thing I didn't enjoy is the computer sound used in all the videos. Because of the computer sound/artificial sound used, it lacked the personal touch one would enjoy. So I have only 2 suggestions to give : 
1) Use a teacher/professor/expert who can teach us and take us through each and every aspect.
2) The assignments are sometimes difficult to complete because certain features are not available in certain excel versions",4

1773,Excel Basics for Data Analysis by IBM,Palotás G A,"Jan 10, 2024","I think the exercises are a bit backwards. Instead of starting with what the specific goal is when using a certain function or feature, they just list the steps that the student needs to follow without having to think and knowing why they are doing this. This decontextualized copying is not a very effective learning method, and it is not how we would you use Excel in real life either. First you have a problem, then you come up with the steps to solve it, not the other way around. 

For example, this is one of the exercises in Week 4:

Task A: Use of VLOOKUP to look up data in a table organized vertically
1. Download the file indian_startup_funding_Lab6.xlsx. Upload and open it using Excel for the web.
2. In cell K2,L2,M2, type VLOOKUP, Startup Name, Amount in USD respectively.
3. Select and copy cells from C9 to C15 and paste in cell L3.
4. In cell M3, type =VLOOKUP(L3, C2:I113, 7, FALSE) and press Enter.
5. Formula: =VLOOKUP (value, table, col_index, [range_lookup]).
6. Hover over the bottom-right corner of cell M3, and drag the Fill Handle down to the cell M9.
7. Select cells from M3 to M9 and select Number Format>Currency.


It could be easily transformed to be more engaging, interactive and effective, where students need to actually think and apply the skills they have just learned in practice, while they are also provided with hints and help along the way. For example:

Task A: 

Preparation:
1.Download the file indian_startup_funding_Lab6.xlsx. 
2.Upload and open it using Excel for the web.

Instructions:
You want to make a report about how much money the following startups managed to raise during their last fundraising:
-Rein Games
-CarDekho
-Dhruva Space
-Paytm
-Aye Finance
-Clumio
-Digital Mall Asia

Use the VLOOKUP function to retreive the necesseray data. 

(Here, a picture of the expected end result could also be shown, so students will have a point of reference to start, and they can also use it to check their solution. Just like in the original exercise, but without revealing the vlookup function. Let's not give away the solution straight away and let's let students experiment).

(Hints: these could be all hidden and accessed through individual drop-down lists, so students will have autonomy to try on their own, but if they are stuck, they can just click on a 'Hint' button and get the help they need to move forward. If they are really stuck, they can reveal the solution by clicking on the ""Solution"" button.).

Hint 1: First think about which columns you will need from the original data set. Then , you want to create a separate table for yourself where you can retieve the data. Name the columns of your new table accordingly. (This could, of course, be phrased with more suitable terminology, this is just an example). 

Solution 1: you will need the columns Startup Name and Amount in USD. In cell K2,L2,M2, type VLOOKUP, Startup Name, Amount in USD respectively.

Hint 2: Then think about whether you need to narrow down the data in your columns.

Solution 2: you only need the 7 startups mentioned above, so copy and past them to your new table. Select and copy cells from C9 to C15 and paste in cell L3.

And so forth. 

This way you train students to be problem-solvers and to think like data analysts. And this is ultimately the goal of the course.

Hope this helps!",3
1774,Excel Basics for Data Analysis by IBM,Aubrey A,"Feb 26, 2023","It looks like some of the MS Excel for Web options have changed/been updated since this course was created, therefore some of the tasks (like converting CSV files to XLSX) are now automatically done.  There are also minor discrepancies in the naming items in Excel vs. the course because of this change.  

Pivot tables are very important to Data Analysts I would like to have seen this lesson divided up further so not to inundate the learner with so much information.

This needs to be fixed in this course. Otherwise, it discourages people from even finishing the course at all. I got marked off on my final project during peer review solely based on a rubric that was completely different than the spreadsheet I was given for the project. I lost almost 1/3 of the points because my answers (which were right) were graded against a rubric that did not even correspond to the spreadsheet project. I understand that IBM wants to change the spreadsheets regularyl to deter cheating, but they also have to change the lab instructions to correspond with whatever version of excel is publicly available and change their grading rubric to match the new spreadsheet that they provide as well.",2
1780,Python for Data Analysis: Pandas & NumPy by Coursera Project Network,Evgeny K,"Jun 10, 2021","Sorry. I have really tried to do my best to go through the project, since I appreciate the efforts of the instructor. He really tries to do a good job introducing a complicated topic in as simple fashion as possible. But...

I have managed to finish just 3 steps of... how many? 12? Why so? Stay tuned guys (c)

At step 1, I have noticed that the instructor does not follow the PEP8 guidelines in the code formatting. Ok, we'll live with this (even though it is stated that basic Python knowledge is required for the project. and PEP8 is among the first topics to be introduced...) I am not an expert in Python, just trying it as hobby, but even I see that the spacing in the code is ugly.

In step 2 (mini-challenge) - the task says to generate the random numbers starting at 0, yet the answer given by the instructor puts 1 instead of 0. Well, the idea is still understandable, let us go on and excuse this glitch (this is not a typo, since it is also being said). 
By the way, ""the basic knowledge of Python is required"" - why not show here how to treat incorrect/erroneous user input? Would be just elegant, in my view. 

Then, in step 3 the instructor uses ""sum"" as a variable name. What the hell is this? Even the IDE showed in color that something strange was going on... By the way, the sum function should have been used just a few lines later (but it was not used - see the next item) - I am excited to see how surprised the instructor would be by the traceback to appear.

Finally, in mini challenge 3 the ""distance between two vectors"" is calculated as the square root of element-wise sum of the vectors squared. Uffffff... Just before this task the instructor has encouraged us to go google what is the distance. I would love to see the definition which he has finally used for the 'official solution'. Basically this means that a distance between two vectors is a vector (???), and if the vectors are equal, the distance in nonzero (???).

Sorry again, but I have had to stop at this point. At the end, this guided project is paid for - do I pay for killing my brain? 

Ah, and by the way, having passed 3 steps of 12 with the instructor, I have managed to answer the final quiz questions using a single attempt and about 3 minutes. Nope, I am not a pro - just yesterday I installed pandas and numpy on my PC. So, even the final quiz is so poorly planned that it required nothing from the guided project to cope with it.

Once again, thank you for the attempt, but so far I would grade it with negative mark if it is possible. Hope this can be corrected - or otherwise I personally find this project unacceptable, and Coursera just loses its face by allowing it in without proper testing.",1

I spent about 8 hours on searching desperately for each assignment. My passion for Python and Data Science almost disappear. 
 The version of pandas used in this course is 0.19.2, which is not convenient for using some functions.
 The assignment is not explained after grading. I had no idea about how well my solution is and whether there is a better way to do it. (The forum may be useful, but it took too much time for searching suitable answers)
 I have learnt Java before and had little experience in Python. Maybe it's the reason for the longer commitment on those assignments. However, as a former teacher, I do suggest some improvements on the pedagogy in this course and take more responsibility for the students. ",1

The trainer Prof. Brooks is highly unlively and plainly reads out/speaks some statements. He teaches only 10%, remaining 90% you need to explore on your own. The Assignments have the most difficult questions and for solving them, students are not even given any getting-started questions, to begin with! If you wish to learn Data Science/Data Analysis then I would not recommend this course since it is not worth the time, effort and money. Also, the title of the course is devaluing the efforts we put it. The entire course is focused towards using Pandas to perform Data Analysis / Data Cleaning / Data Wrangling / Data Munging / Data Preprocessing and thus I would recommend that the title of the course should be one of these rather than ""Introduction ..."" which hardly gives any weight to what hard work this certification demands!
In the brief course videos professor makes some hand gestures and the background shows the people working - both has no relevance and rather prove to be a distraction. Above that auto-grader comes with its own lot of problems which consume hours and days of all the candidates.

1839,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Xiaoke L,"Mar 19, 2019","I have to say, the quality of this course is significantly inferior than the previous ""Programming to everybody"" . Firstly, it has something to do with the language that the lecturer uses to explain the concepts in Python. The language he uses is unnecessarily complicated. The sentences are very long and the words he uses are vague . If you want to explain a relatively complex concept, you need to use simpler and more comprehensible words. You cannot use a complex concept to explain another complex concept. The second thing is about the structure of the course, the insufficient engagement. The lecture is full of contents but only with very less interaction exercises. This will make students lost in the half way.

The exercises often have issues in datasets that are not linked to current lesson which makes it confusing to follow along and you can spend hours searching forums to find solutions.  In addition, the course does not give sufficient insight in videos to help you with questions.  You have to search stack overflow and other sources to work out answers.  Whilst this is reflective of real life, for an intro course which is how this was framed, it is difficult for someone new to data science to master a concept whilst trying to solve for other non related issues searching the web.",1

1844,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Qiaohong W,"Dec 19, 2018","The course covers good grounds if you are new to pandas. However the content is pretty much a read-through of documentation and assignments are designed poorly:
1) There are loads of knowledge required to finish the assignment that are not addressed in the course. You will need to find those out yourself online, which in itself isn't a problem but you are also paying coursera for the time when you pretty much do self-learning
2) Due to how assignments are graded, you have to provide EXACT answers as the instructors wanted to see, meanwhile you don't get all information needed on what should be the right answer as certain parameters of the assignment are not clearly defined. The forum is disorganised and you end up spending a lot of time browsing through historical posts, some of which remain unanswered after months
3) Too much time spent on data cleaning. Granted that in real world projects data cleaning is at least 80% of the time but this is a learning course. You don't get to spend a lot of time to practice contents covered in video but struggling with the random complexities introduced by the raw data + specific results being expected. This leads to a frustrating experience.
Suggestion to the course instructor: re-design the assignments to make sure students spend more time on key points covered by video. Have one assignment focused on data cleaning, but not all of them. Also review forum questions and understand where people get frustrated, and improve your instructions in the assignments.
Suggestion to fellow students: it is probably best to enroll the course, note the content/ resources, quit (so you don't need to pay) then learn yourself on google/ stackoverflow. This will be pretty much the same experience.",2

1846,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Irene Z,"Jul 12, 2019","Excellent material. Admittedly I can see why there are so many negative reviews about the ambiguity of the assessed tasks. It won't be an easy course for anyone who is unfamiliar with programming. However, if you do have programming experience under your belt, you'll likely find this course strikes an excellent balance in terms of conciseness, practice, and theory. Each lecture is crafted carefully to teach you about some nuance of pandas or numpy, and the programming assignments are packed with coding questions that will help you revise what you have learned, in a very efficient way. There is very little ""fluff"" in this course, which is a major weakness I've seen in similar courses of its kind. Too much spoon feeding often does not challenge or engage the learner. The course is very direct about what it expects of its students. Every week there is a comment ""This week's assignment requires more self-learning than the last"". And true to its word, there is less and less hand-holding as you go further into the course. I thoroughly enjoyed the material and probably learned the most out of this course than any other course I've taken on Coursera, taking in to account its length.",5
1847,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Michael N,"Apr 7, 2019","So, I have some strong opinions about this course. It should really be called Mastering Pandas for Data Science because despite the word introduction in it's name this course basically starts at an intermediate level and skips straight over teaching the basics of anything, including Pandas. You will have to already know quite well: Python, Pandas, Database style thinking and working, Statistics and Autograder intricacies. It basically took me well over 100 hours to get it done. If I had already learned Pandas or R elsewhere before it would have taken less than half that but basically everything I did had to be looked up on StackOverflow or in the Pandas documentation. However, at the end of it I feel like I actually know basic level Pandas and I am now intermediate level. In the end, a great course but very, very challenging.",5
1848,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Nathan H,"Dec 18, 2018","There are several inherent problems with this course and how it is structured. I would like to preface this review by stating that I am likely below the level of python mastery required to complete the course; I came in with a simple background of some time spent learning from introductory texts, but I've never worked with the language professionally and I have been out of practice for a couple years. The course is labeled 'intermediate', though how 'intermediate' is unclear since there is only one elementary course recommended to get you ""up to speed"" enough to take the class. I used my free week as a test to see if my background was enough to be able to hang with this; it was not. 
However, even for someone with more depth of understanding than me, this course is poorly designed to teach. Each lecture is between 2 and 10 minutes long, and they do a very poor job of explaining concepts. The notes provided in the supplied notebooks lack any sort of meaningful documentation, and so it becomes trivial to get lost as the lectures go on at lightning speed and you have no comments or notations at all in-text to explain how one thing they did is different from the next. 
Furthermore, the difficulty and complexity of concepts spikes up rapidly. Using the in-lecture questions as a barometer, the complexity jump is like going from addition to calculus in the blink of an eye. The first in-lecture question during one of the early videos requests you make a very simple change to a supplied piece of code to add three numbers instead of two. Two in-lecture questions later you're asked to create a list of all possible combinations of a number and letter system for a hypothetical internet company based loosely on concepts you learned 15 minutes ago and never before had a chance to break down or practice in any real detail.
After quiz 1 is where I threw in the towel. Looking at the future assignments, as well as the discussion board, things seemed like they would only get worse, not better. Assignments are highly complex and rely on an understanding of python well beyond what this course, and the one before it, will give you. Users with years of programming experience were having to rely on google, text books, and stack exchange to solve the assignments. 
This course is too light on details and too focused on speed. You'll essentially be teaching yourself what you're supposed to do. As my first attempt going through a MOOC, this was a letdown. Part of this is on me, as I do not have the requisite background to fully engage and succeed here. Part of it is on the structure of the course, which truthfully seems to focus on speed and ease for the creators rather than in depth of understanding for the students. If you're considering this track, I recommend instead picking up some textbooks and going through this yourself. You'll lose the certifiable, but you'll have a less frustrating time. ",2
1849,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Georg S,"Feb 20, 2017",This course was fast paced but the material was interesting and not to complex. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in Data Science and who already has a basic knowledge of Python.,5

1851,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Mark C,"Oct 8, 2018","My take -- assignments for week 3 and 4 leave a bad impression. I am quitting halfway through assignment 4. I won't take another class in this sequence. I have taken ~10 online classes this year and only gave up on 2, including this one.
I wasted too much time in weeks 3 and 4 cleaning data. When result dataframes have hundreds of rows it isn't trivial to scroll through them looking for problems. Time wasted on this would have been better spent on pandas. I get that data cleaning is a big part of data science, but this is a class not a job.
A few questions tended to be vague on requirements but then very particular on what data is acceptable. The worst is getting a question wrong because the answer has type int64 and the grader wanted int. It doesn't help when the grader just says 'wrong answer' and there are no visible tests. The first question on assignment 4 is a good example of that. I did finish convert_housing_data_to_quarters, but from reading discussion forums that too has a few unstated requirements.
There were also a few typos in assignments 3 and 4. Again, if you want my answers to be really accurate then invest some time to make sure your questions aren't ambiguous.
This could be a valuable class, but you need to invest more in developing the assignments.",1
1852,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Asmund B,"Feb 20, 2019","I have been doing some coding in different languages and this is my first time in Python. I would say I am on intermediate level (7 years practice), but this course made me spend a lot of time on learning only a tidy bit. The course fails in the basic educational purpose: Provide theoretical lectures and apply it with practical experience. There was little to none connection between these two aspects. The exercises were also way too difficult vs the lectures. I would never recommend this course.
My recommendation: Don't make the student spend too much time googling, and solving problem outside of the curriculum, but provide many easy questions as it is a introductory course. Also, Provide a better overlap of exercises vs lectures.",1
1853,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Henrik F,"May 17, 2019","The difference between exercises and lectures is too big. You end up researching elsewhere more than just follow the course.
Exercises being graded is a challenge > installed grader version is different (older) than the note book. This led to the point that my exercises weren't graded due to exception because I used a more recent feature of Python Libraries
Week 4 programming assignment was a challenge: To pass the final question you need to figure out the previous questions as well, other wise you do not get the right answer. In case you got it wrong it is near impossible to figure out the root cause (because the grader doesn't give you elaborate clues where you might correct things).  You do not get enough side information on your own so as to solve any issues on your own.
The content covered in the specialization would exactly be the things I'd want to learn, but the learning experience was full of bumps ...probably I won't follow up on the next courses of this specialization.
I heartily recommend an overhaul of this course, giving learners some more background by more explanation & providing more consistent information to master programming exercises.
On the positive side: Staff was helpful for a couple of open questions,. Even as the learning experience wasn't as good as anticipated I learned quite some Python stuff due to the contents of the course. ",2
1854,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Ben N,"Jan 2, 2019",The class is mostly problem set focused with no feedback on what makes for good pandas code beyond it getting the correct result. Not a good resource for learning the pandas library. Very little teaching. ,1

This course and specialization will teach you how to use all the commonly used Python libraries for Data Science applications (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK etc.). And comparing to some of the other specializations I've taken in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Maths after completing this one, I can say that the programming assignments are by far the best I've encountered on Coursera so far. The learning curve is pretty steep at first (it was for a total beginner like me) but you'll learn a lot quickly. And by the end you'll be able to do most Data Science tasks independently.

 ""This assignment requires more individual learning than previous assignment"" 
This essentially translates into you using google to look up how to do the 90% of the homework they don't cover in the lectures. 
Also this course should also be changed to be ""Introduction to Data Cleaning in Python"" because you do more data cleaning than anything else in this course.

1860,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Darien M,"Nov 15, 2019","This course is not conducive to learning, but rather to getting results. I understand that in the ""real world"" programmers would simply search the web for questions. This is because they need to produce results for their companies. We, as students, need to learn. We are not taking the course to learn what it is like to be a programmer, but rather to understand how the programs work and how to improve our thinking skills. This course taught me how to navigate Stack Overflow and other online resources for Pandas. I was pretty diligent about  trying to understand what I was doing, but it definitely wasn't a requirement for the course. That is my problem: one could sneak by in this course without even understanding a thing. They could simply copy and paste code from the internet , tweak, hit submit  and repeat until they have a 100%. Just a small example, in the last question we do not have to interpret our results in any way whatsoever, just get results. This is not learning.

The course is not self-contained, and the assignment is much harder than the content of the course videos. It takes >8 hours per assignment, and it does require some previous programming experience. 
I have seen complaints about the difficulty of the assignment. However, if someone really wants to learn how to do data science and programming, one cannot copy and paste everything from others' or some lecturer's code. Data wrangling is important work when dealing with real-life data, and he or she must knowing how to read through documents and extract information by themselves.  There's no shortcut if you really want to learn Python and pandas. From dealing with real life data, I learned a lot in this course. However, I suggest that the lecturer should provide some simple lecture videos on how to read documents and how to effectively search for relevant content on the internet. Many students may not have appropriate programming skill background before taking this course.",5
1862,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,SB,"Apr 15, 2018","I was really excited about the this course, and was really let down. This course is really, really poorly done. I would not waste time and money on this course when there are much better options out there. I feel like I've gotten little in return for my time and money.
First, there is no accompanying book (only slides).  A self-contained accompanying book is a valuable resource, helping students prepare for lecture, and serving as a reference manual later on (I still regularly use my Coursera book on introductory Python).  That there is no pdf reference for this class is indefensible (both of the other coursera courses I’ve had access to have had excellent self-contained books that followed the lecture). Instead, the student is directed to several other books they can purchase elsewhere.
Second, as several other students have noted, the timeframe for assignments is really unrealistic, taking much longer than projected (at least for me, and several other students).  This is not acceptable when Coursera bills by the month. Coursera needs to provide a better assessment of the time commitments for the class.  Moreover, several of the in-video quizzes are disconnected from the material, often requiring extra research.  Consulting other resources is fine (it’s part of coding), but the point of the quizzes should be to give the student practice implementing a concept that was just introduced.
Third, the teaching is horrific. The professor is not engaging at all, but simply mechanically reads lines which often sound straight out of a user manual.  The point of online videos is not to turn books into audio files- it’s to have a human talk/reason through problems with you. The teacher of the course should discuss the material, not recite a manual.  A great example of well-done online teaching is Dr. Chuck Severance, whose videos the teachers of this course would do well to consult.  In addition, the material is presented far too quickly.  
Fourth, the title of this course is a misnomer: an introduction to data science would provide an overview of the tools, techniques and scope of the field.  An extremely detailed introduction to Pandas, which is essentially what most of this course is, is useful if well executed (which it is not here), but it is not an introduction to data science. 
A more minor complaint is the absolutely horrendous choice of the background.  Showing different permutations of lifeless office drones is not exactly inspiring material for aspiring data scientists, even if this the reality of office life- it’s distracting at best, and at worst, deeply disparaging. Why not have just a plain colored background? Or anything else?
The experience of this class is making me question whether I will ever pay for a Coursera course again.  The amount of time I’ve wasted on pointless exercises is not warranted by what I’ve learned from this class- in retrospect I would have learned more just by purchasing one of the books referred to in the class introduction. ",1
1863,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,William G,"Jan 22, 2019","Important material, but taught in a far less optimal manner than Python for Everybody (or maybe Dr. Chuck's material is just the gold standard). 
Material is explained at a high level extremely quickly, with very little explanation of the underlying fundamentals of what's going on. Videos are generally of the instructor talking, not actually slides depicting what happens when you're calling a function like loc. 
Gold stars for the helpful forum posts from the TAs though - would have probably spent 2-3x the time if not for their posts. The week notebooks are also quite helpful - I recommend just reading the transcripts and following along the notebooks, and only using the video  when something really does not make immediate sense.

1865,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Ray M,"Jul 13, 2019","I cannot recommend anyone to do this course - it's ridiculously poorly constructed.  I have done four other courses on Coursera (including several other python courses) and all were excellent.  The quality of this course though is appalling in comparison.  
FIRSTLY They do not TEACH any of the material.  Instead they simply list - very briefly - a ton of functions/ methods/ objects etc without providing any real details of how they operate.  Teaching the basics and then expecting the students to do further study and practice using those basics would be fine.  Spending 30 seconds or less on a function / method/ objects is NOT teaching the basics.   READING A TEXTBOOK on the topics covered was more effective then doing the course material!!!  What kind of modern on-line course is less effective at teaching a topic than a textbook?
SECONDLY The autograder for the programming assignments is a joke.  I took the course to learn how to code successfully.  The autograder does not test that - it could not even get question 1 of assignment 3 correct.  Instead, the students are expected to read through the forums and then spend hours making ridiculously stupid adjustments to corrects for errors present in the autograder.  Seriously?  If you are not capable of building a autograder that works, don't have programming assignments that require an autograder.  But realistically, if you are not capable of building an autograder that works, you have no business offering an on-line programming course.
REALLY disappointed.  This course should be removed until its quality is significantly improved - it detracts significantly from the Coursera brand name.  If this was the first course I had done on Coursera, I would have thought the platform rubbish and would never have done a second course.  Even now I am concerned about how many other of the courses are this unprofessional.  I've gone from being a huge Coursera admirer and advocate to now not being sure how much I will use (or endorse) the platform going forwards.",1

I found myself using apply and groupby methods when they were only introduced in Week 2. Suffice to say, my first few hours on the course can only be describe as 'painful'.
I would suggest to anyone reading this to watch Brandon Rhodes' Pycon 2015 lecture. It was way more engaging, and his explanation of concepts were much clearer. The exercises were well paced, and after spending 6 hours or so on both the video and the exercises, my mind has never been clearer on Pandas.

1867,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Divyasom M,"Nov 5, 2019","Personally I am rating this course at the lowest level possible. 
Here are my reasons for doing so:
The course videos do not teach you much. The video lectures are super condensed and lot of information comes your way and actually trying that out on Jupyter notebook on the side easily takes 5-6 times. When you get down to the assignments, you will realize that videos only scratched the surface of the topic and in some cases some of the concepts to be used were not at all discussed in the videos.
You have to learn by yourself, and your best friends are StackOverflow, Google, Python and Pandas documentation. Once you have researched and spent hours putting together the solution to assignments, you will spend more hours struggling with the autograder (At this moment, I am stuck for over two weeks with the autograder at Week3 of the course). If you get the autograder to work then also all you are just going to get pass/ fail result and there is no actual reinforcement that the way you tackled a problem was an efficient way of doing so.

It also showed me how awesome Jupyter notebooks is to use. I'll be using it in all of my Python courses moving forward, whether or not the course requires it. I will say though that the estimates for the amount of time the courses will take per week are way too low. This is a problem I've encountered on every MOOC platform I've ever used though. They really just want to get you in and saying that you'll be spending 15 hours per week on a course will scare many people away. I've easily spent more than that for some weeks in this course. In the end though, I didn't feel that my time was wasted. The assignments are challenging and really force you to get better at Python if you want to try to solve them on your own and not immediately resort to the forums. I'm probably just a bit of a masochist that way, and it honestly may have doubled the amount of time it took to finish the course, but I find trying to solve the problems with as little guidance as possible very rewarding. You just become a better coder overall.However! If time is a major concern and masochism isn't your thing I highly recommend just giving it a go for only an hour or so if you're stuck end then going to the Discussion Forums.

At times you may get frustrated, you may ask why i am taking this course if i have to look around so much for the answers by myself. But if you stick there, you will learn a lot. Maybe you will retain  more because concepts were not spoon-fed to you but you found them. That journey is a huge learning experience. 
I would not suggest absolute beginner to take this course. Learn some python , practice a bit and then join this course.

1884,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Bruno S P P,"Jul 15, 2020","My background: Industrial Engineer with a decent programming background (including Python), but rusty with statistics.
My review: The instructors clearly know what they are talking about and explains useful concepts.  However, the videos are very short, and some concepts feels rushed. The assignments are pretty challenging, which is a nice thing. The last one in particular is very nice and don't feel fabricated - you actually test an interesting hypothesis based on some data you have to extract and manipulate. To be able to finish the assigments, I had to use Google a lot. It kinda felt like cheating, but the course is pretty clear that you should look in the documentations and ask questions on Stack Overflow.
Suggestions:
Include more exercises to practice what was taught in the videos.
Include a solution for each assignment - some questions I got it right, but I am sure my answer was not the most efficient or ""pandorable"" one. It would be nice to have a benchmark to compare after we pass the assignemnts.",4
1885,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Ainur A,"Nov 28, 2020","The course was undoubtedly challenging (which in itself is a good thing), but at times it was more challenging than it had to be because of some little errors, inconsistecies, wording in the assignment, etc. Sometimes some files wouldn't be where they were supposed to be. Sometimes it took me more time to actually understand what I was supposed to do than actually doing it, because it wasn't really clear what was required. Ok, English is not my first language but I am quite good. Besides, lots of other students complained about confusing wording, so it's not just me. Sometimes some instructions were missing and you'd only realise that after digging through the discussion forums for hours. So, basically there were a few things that made the whole experience more difficult than it had to be, and they weren't about knowledge or skils but about the course ""infrastructure"". 
Before I started this course I'd already taken a few courses on Python programming (on a different platform), including numpy and pandas, but the assinments in this course were still qute difficult for me. You have to do a lot of searching online to get to the solution. In general, I'm all for the idea of having to do more self-learning but the online format is already more challenging than face-to-face learning, so I think it would help to have a few guided exercises between the lectures to understand the material better. Maybe if I had more experience with Python and programming, it would be easier.
One thing that disappointed me was that they recommended a book (optional reading), but you would have to purchase it. Now, if we were studying on campus then we would have access to the university library where we could borrow this book (probably), but as online students we don't have that option. I understand that they can't just upload copywrited books for anyone to access but maybe they could come up with a system that would allow students to somehow access the books temporarily, or make just a few necessary chapters available. I think that's for Coursera to manage, not for the University of Michigan though, because the university can only take advantage of whatever technology coursera can offer (at least that's my understanding).
On a positive note, the discussion forums were quite helpful, and the teaching staff were quick to answer most of the time. I suggest, if you take this course, then take full advantage of the discussion forums. 
I also liked that there were two types of assignments (multiple choice quiz and programming). I think that's a great idea.
So, overall, if they made a few improvements to the course, it would be a great one.",3
1886,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Jun-Hoe L,"Oct 9, 2020","Decided to rate this course after I've gone through all 5 courses in the Speclisation. I originally completed this course in January 2020.
So from someone who has completed this Specialisation, I'd say this 5 courses are not worth it.
Here's how I would rank the courses from best to worst:
1. Social Network Analysis: 4.5 stars
2. Applied Machine Learning: 3.5-4 stars
3. Applied Text Mining: 3.5 stars
4. Intro to Data Science: 2 
5. Plotting:1
Note that that worst courses are those handled by Professor Brooks himself. His video lectures tend to very superficial (or once in a while, unnecessarily detailed like going into the backend of matplotlib). The assignments on the other hand, are somewhat challenging and go way beyond the video lectures. And that's why you see many comments asking what's the point of purchasing this course when you spend 95% of the time googling? Which is made worse by the outdated autograder which uses and old panda version, and makes googling harder since you had to revert to outdated code. 
My advice: Unless you really want the Specialisation cert, I think you should look elsewhere to learn pandas.  ",2
1887,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Bart C,"Aug 19, 2018","This course provides very little instruction. I really like learning by trial and error, and I think that is how coding is typically learned. Learning python from stack_exchange, however, is how I was already learning it, and I was doing fine. The whole problem of learning from stack exchange is that you don't know if you are doing things in the best possible way, which can be important for big datasets. There was no discussion of the best practices for complete an assignment, after it was turned in, and, in general, may functions were required to pass the course that were never discussed in the course. The entire weeks lecture could also be watched in about 30 minutes, which seems low to me. Most courses I have taken have at least three hours a week of lecture. I have friends who have taken this same course, and had a similar assessment.",2
1888,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Carl G,"Apr 10, 2018",Not my style of  course. Lectures is a mostly just a list of code snippets without any slides. Instead there is a background of 2 people just staring at their screens the whole time. Does not inspire one to enjoy Data Science as a field. Prefer a narrative explaining why and how with practical tips thrown in. Learning to code is more than just syntax. Good examples are the first chapter in Think Stats by Allen Downey and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. In this course the assignments took quite a bit of time to complete since lecture code snippets not very useful. Had to self-learn from web to complete assignments. Also took extra time by some trial and error to get right format of results. A more productive approach was assignments in A,2
1889,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Bas R,"Feb 11, 2020","Topics covered are interesting as next steps when you have some basic programming skills in Python. However, the introduction and explanation of new concepts feel very rushed; a one minute video on map(), then lambda with a quick exercise without further explanation, followed by list comprehension at the same pace. I often found myself stopping the videos and googling for further explanation to understand what is really going on. If instructors feel that such concepts should be familiar to someone participating in the course, then I'd recommend not covering them at all, rather than rapidly rushing through.",2
1890,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Muhammad A,"Apr 19, 2020","I would not recommend this course at all. This is for a number of reasons.
The lectures are not really lectures, they are more of a narration of someone else writing code on screen, the intructor just whizzes through what's happening without giving any proper explanation (I cannot stress this enough). The limited explanation provided is just on what's happening on the screen rather than why we're doing it this way compared to any other way. There is also not enough guidance given in the lectures but told to just figure it out and go post on Stack Overflow. Anyone familiar with Stack Overflow should know, they *really* do not like beginners posting repetitive questions - so I find that advice from the instructor really odd.
The courses makes use of Numpy, but gives zero explanation on what Numpy is and why we use it. It just dives into it by using Numpy arrays and expects you to either magically understand it or go learn what/why Numpy, from someone else.
Speaking about assignments, a lot of the excercises require you to do something which hasn't been covered in the sessions at all. I understand giving a challene in assignments, but I would much rather prefer those challenges be related to things taught or from resources given / pointed to. But, unfortunately, you have to figure a lot out on your own and the videos are of no help.
It also doesn't help that the assignment feedback is very lacking. The grader also does not tell you what answer it expects, so you have no way of knowing how far off your answer is.
This is further not helped by the out-dated version of Pandas running (0.19.2). It has a 4 year old version. I tried to do the assignments locally, but then coming onto Coursera to find the methods I've used aren't supported. This causes further frustation with the ""go learn on your own"" approach, as every resource you'll find will be using methods/functions from the latest versions. You then have to spend hours more finding legacy methods for what you're trying to do (which, in practice, will be useless as you will always be working on updated packages)
In my opinion, this course is not worth the money. I would highly recommend you trial its contents before deciding whether to pay for it or not.",1
1891,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Maria K,"Nov 22, 2020","Task formulations and goals explanation in assignments description are extremely bad,  I've almost turned grey trying to understand what is the main purpose of exercise.

The only way to deal with this is to googling and searching for the answer in discussions forums, StackOverflow and Github.
But, unfortunately, I haven't find anything better on coursera for my current programming level.

1904,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Zhenxun Z,"Jan 12, 2017","I really like Prof. Brooks's way of teaching. He developed a very good introductory level course. Apart from some talks about data science in a whole, he concentrated on the preparatory work in this field -- data cleaning. Instead of delving into theories, he paid most of his attention to how to make things work by using python. I actually have a background in C, and I was a bit reluctant to learn python at first since C is already strong enough to attack most tasks. However, I have fallen in love with python now, and I think it is a much more suitable language for daily use especially when your projects aren't very large. Among its many merits, the best thing about python is of course its numerous libraries like numpy and pandas which free us from tedious low-level programming. I am quite convinced that I will move to python from now on.
In addition to lectures, I truly recommend you go over extra reading materials. Those articles are very thought provoking. For example, the first one ""50 Years of Data Science"" totally changed my previous view towards this field. It made me realize that data science is not a simple combination of statistics and machine learning, that it is a distinct way of obtaining new knowledge, and that its advancement shall benefit the whole science society.
About the assignments, those taught in the lecture are not enough and you should refer to python documents and stack overflow. I think knowing how to solve problems and where to find help is more important than solving problems itself, and that's why I consider those assignments well designed.

Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments. From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?) and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions. Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student! This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue. (BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.) This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer. (Wish I had a good recommendation as an alternative.)
The only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets, to complete specific tasks, during week 3. (This was as much time as I could afford to allocate to this course.)

1922,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Jeffrey D R,"May 8, 2018","Like many others, I give this course a high rating while lodging a minor complaint that there wasn't much instruction provided. The lectures were excellent, if brief; it's hard to imagine anyone having objections to the instructor. But in terms of teaching the material, it was a bit of a drive-by. The lectures show a few examples, while not explaining the syntax or the various parameters. You have to draw that out of web sites and cheat sheets. If you're not adept at doing that, proceed with caution here. In the end, I was worn out from the effort, but felt that I had gained a lot. 
The assignments were challenging for me because this was my first hands-on experience with Python, much less with Pandas. I did not find Stack Overflow as helpful as the instructor suggested. Nor did I find much help in the forums, but that's not quite my style. 
My bottom line is that the course was time well-spent, but it could easily have been a six-week course with a more deliberate pace through the various pandas mechanisms such as merging and grouping. 
FWIW: My recommendation is to get to know Jupyter Notebook early and follow along with the lectures by opening the Week[x] files in the course download folder. You can pause the lecture while you go play with the code to make sure you understand it.  Also, I recommend working with a local version of Jupyter and keep your files local. Otherwise, Jupyter loses connection to the kernel, and stops being able to save your work. The messages are disconcerting, and if you've worked yourself into a frenzy, they can cause panic and confusion. So do all the work on your machine and then upload the whole assignment when you are finished.  You upload on the ""Create a Submission"" screen; it takes only a sec. You won't even have to worry about details like file paths; they'll be the same either way.  Once you get the hang of Jupyter, you can settle into a work routine. Learn some of the keyboard shortcuts. ",5

Also, the course seems rushed: I'm not sure what the end game of these courses is, but I think it's an incredible wasted opportunity when it comes to MOOCs, as there could be more lengthy videos and more and better ungraded exercises (something that in this particular course do not exist) and much, much better explained assignments (I guess adding there the info from the forums by the teaching stuff would not hurt).
For being a course of intermediate level, the videos and explanations are too short; there are even places where things are left totally unexplained.
Even if it's supposed (and even encouraged) that the students seek information on their own, the lack of context in some places makes it rather difficult. this is specialy more so with the questions that are interwined in the videos, as normally in order to answer them corretly you have to go out and find the related info (something that totally disrupts watching the videos).
finally, the assignments are a wreckage; some of the questions are incredible difficult to understand, if not out right impossible. The fact that there's a lot of information added to the forums by the etaching stuff, up to the point that the more complicated questions are easily answered with that same infromation, proves this.
I do think there are examples of  courses in Coursera: I recently completed ""Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra"" and even thought I don't think it's not without its issues, I find it a much more challenging, entertaining and fun course, that covers in a good way its subject. 
I have to commend the people from the teaching stuff that are in the forums, thought, as it's the only course in which I found people from the teaching area activelly participating, and helping the students.",2
1937,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Michael O,"Feb 2, 2023","In my opinion not really a course. You get simple hints in the videos what can be done with dataframes and co and 90 % has to be find by yourself in the internet. Very often the teacher says after running a code ""as we can see..."", but you can see it only if you run the code in parallel, because the teacher does not show the relevant result. For the assignment 3 you have to search a lot in the internet and use trial&error to get the correct result.  The notebooks are not very useful for looking up later and you have no slides to download or similar.
The questions in assignment 3 are very sloppy and inaccurate written. Check the forum contributions before starting to avoid a lot of mistakes due to possible misunderstandings. 
The speed is very fast (even at 75 %) and all topics are only touched upon briefly. 
The only advantages compared to Youtube videos are that you have assignments. There should be a lot more exercises in between instead of having after hours of videos only a difficult assignment.",2
1938,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Zayd A,"May 29, 2019","I had done ""Python for Everybody"" from Charles Severance which I had found excellent, with the instructor being passionate and the pace being just about right. I had assumed it would be similar for ""Introduction to Data Science in Python"", but that wasn't case. The delivery of the course is at a very very fast pace, you don't even have time to stop and absorb the functions and methods that you are supposed to learn. The instructor and the research assistant will list the functions and methods one after the other without pausing. The assignment is then extremely hard with no resemblance to the material in the course (I couldn't do it even after having reviewed the videos). After holding on for the first 2 weeks (it's a very useful topic after all), I gave up and decided to learn from the ""learning the Pandas library book"", which is a very good summary of the main Pandas functions and methods (and which was recommended by Dr Christopher Brooks), and I was able to follow it very easily. ",2
1939,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Sanwal Y,"Mar 15, 2021","This course is not very well structured. A lot of the things that are on the assignments/quizzes are relegated to readings in the books and never discussed in the videos. The book readings are overwhelming for a week worth and require at least 2 times more to finish than what is suggested in the course. That is assuming you want to run the code in the book and not just do a hacky job of just reading it and not understanding the code. 
The instructor is fine and does well enough but the structure of this course needs to be reevaluated and the time allotment needs to be made by someone actually doing those readings/assignments and not just an idealized number that they expect unreasonably from their students. 
There are better courses to start with your data science journey and this isn't the one to go to, in my opinion. ",2
1940,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Aaron B,"Mar 20, 2019","Really appreciate this course. Got me started in Python, Pandas, and Jupyter. First week felt like magic. I am giving it a low score because the assignment questions were so ambiguous that it required constant resubmits an scouring the forums. The ratio of learning of course content to required Stack Overflow internet research was way off balance.
I learned a lot but was extremely frustrated and burned a lot of time it what I felt was all the wrong places.
Still grateful for this opportunity. I think the questions can be better explained and tightened up.",2

They assume we know everything, I wouldn't be able to follow if i haven't done python in data analysis before, g, so they go fast and doesn't explain how everything/every function works. But if they assume we know everything, there is no need for the lecture videos. Just give us the assignments and just ask us to look at stackoverflow. The videos are 90% useless.",2

It definitely would be 1* for assignments. The way they are designed and described (especially in Week 3 and Week 4 ) makes it impossible to solve them without referring to the forum where there are many clarifications.

1945,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Joseph G,"Mar 4, 2018","Not sure whether this course is trying to reach data science or Python, but it does a poor job at both.
The class is a light-speed tour through NumPy and Pandas, definitely not for the neophyte Python developer (which I am not). There's 30-40 mins of lecture each week that's basically lightly narrated typing into a Jupyter notebook with only the slightest bit of additional explanation about what the instructor is doing, although the material covered is substantial. There's lot of important details that are glossed over -- forcing the student to pause the lecture and do offline research to understand what just happened.
Similarly, the assignments address and cover beyond the material covered, but the instruction is scarcely sufficient to understand the concepts required to complete them, so lots of Stack Overview and other research is required. And the automated grader, as expected, is completely literal so for complex problems, not much help in validating whether you're on the right track. Assignments take many multiples of the estimated time.
And because even for paying students (such as myself), you never get access to an answer key even after the assignment is due, you have no idea how closely your solution conformed to best practices, even if you arrived at the right answer. For coding, this makes all of the difference, particularly with large datasets that could consume considerable computing resources if not done correctly. I'm told this is because of potential cheating by learners.
How would I change this course? Simple: 3x more lecture material to actually explain what's going on, or down-scope the class so that the existing lecture time becomes adequate for the material.",1
1946,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,David M,"Feb 2, 2024","the course content felt like a mishmash of basic statistics and paywall-locked articles, leaving me underwhelmed and questioning the value of my investment. It's disheartening to see such fundamental concepts hidden behind a paywall, making it feel more like a money-making scheme than an educational endeavor.

The exercises, while intended to reinforce learning, fell short of engaging and challenging. Instead, they were monotonous and repetitive, failing to simulate real-world scenarios effectively. Additionally, the insistence on manually coding names and resorting to external sources for basic information felt outdated and disconnected from modern data science practices.

One peculiar aspect of the course was the inclusion of an hour-long lesson on regular expressions (regex). While regex can be a valuable tool in data manipulation, dedicating an entire hour to it seemed excessive, especially considering the limited relevance to the broader scope of data science.

However, the most glaring omission was the absence of machine learning and deep learning concepts. In a field evolving as rapidly as data science, neglecting these fundamental topics is a disservice to students seeking to stay abreast of industry trends and advancements.

In conclusion, while the course may offer some insights into basic statistics and data manipulation techniques, its outdated approach and lack of comprehensive content make it difficult to recommend. Unless significant updates are made to address these shortcomings, prospective learners would be better off exploring alternative resources for their data science education.",1
1947,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Guillermo O d A,"Mar 18, 2022","I dropped this course. The complexity of the assignments is absurd and the autograder does not give much information about what is supposed to be wrong.  Many people have problems with the assigments because the forum is packed with posts about all sorts of difficulties. I managed to complete all the assignments but the last one. In the last one I wasted so much time that I came to realize that there was not point in wasting any more time with this assignment and this course. If the remaining of the specialization is like this, it is going to be a nightmare. I will choose another data analysis course in Coursera, sinze there are a few available.",1

The same is valid I believe for the rest of the world. The coursera platform was not intended exclusively for US and Canada students?

2- Assignments only use like 10 to 15% only of the given info from the video

I really like the approach when you are given the basics and algorithms but you have to investigate the topic yourself to solve tasks - it's the most effective way to learn something. However I understand why some people may not like it. 
I would like to mention the forum support - all the questions are solved very-very quickly, thanks a lot to the teachers!
The thing I didn't really like was the last assignment - 4 Qs out of 5 are the same... So if you manage to solve Q1 - others just require some boring data preparation, I understand that it happes in real life, but why here, it only takes time and annoys you?   
I would recommend this course for those who has already worked with Python and knows all the basic classes and structures. If not - it's better to take some introductory course (it will be useful anyway, better to start with the fundamentals) .
PS: I really don't understand the comments here of people wh0 complain that they had to go to stackoverflow or read documentation - that's what you do when you code",5
1953,Introduction to Data Science in Python by University of Michigan,Steven C S,"Aug 6, 2020","This is a hard course. It takes much more time than what is listed. It is frustrating because you need to do a lot of work on Stackoverflow or other sources to find solutions to assignments.  The lectures aren't lectures, just quick talks about what can be done with Pandas, scipy and numpy. That being said, the professor treats you like a grown-up professional, gives hard real world problems with dirty real world data and asks for you to come up with questions to problems.  That being said when you're done you look back and think, darn that was hard but I can actually apply data cleaning with python/pandas to data you might have lying around. As Poe said, It was the best of times and the worst of times, I couldn't decide if I loved the teaching style or hated it, but all in all I can say I learned a lot, though I complained a lot along the way.",5

The course gives you the basic foundations, most of which are necessary to solve the course, but there are some methods & expressions that you'd have to Google for yourself.

Specifically, the exercises are excellent as they are real problems, which has many untidy problems to overcome during the process, and it's such a pragmatic train on me. Two suggestions: 1 is to add the answers of the assignments, because even though students pass the assignments, there might be  better codes to refer and learn; 2 is to strengthen the problem description, as there're several negligence in those assignments.

1956,Process Mining: Data science in Action by Eindhoven University of Technology,Eric R,"Apr 2, 2021","I've completed the course with Honours, and If you wish to learn Process Mining, this is the course for you. I do however, have a number of problems with the learning material, which is why I've given 3 stars.
First, learning ProM, one of the Process Mining tools (the other being Disco). ProM is meant to be a more flexible and powerful tool, and is considerably more difficult to understand than Disco. However, Disco actually got its own video series explaining the details of how it works, with a step-by-step walkthrough. The ProM walkthrough was hidden inside the Honours Tool Quiz. There is a single video before that which gives an overview of ProM, but that's all it is, an overview.
In my personal opinion, the real reason ProM is difficult, is because it has a confusingly designed interface and little in-app explanation of its workings. This is, however, besides the point, and I'm not letting this impact the review of the course itself. I would just like to contest the concept of something necessarily being more difficult to learn just because it can do more.
Onwards to my second main gripe with this course - I was not impressed by the quality of the learning material. In one particular instance, when they introduce the Alpha algorithm, they begin by dumping 8 lines of dense set theory. Mind you, I'm already familiar with set theory, but I feel sorry for anyone who does not. I would have appreciated a more intuitive explanation.
Mind you - as I said before, if you are interested in Process Mining, this is a course you want to try. I just have high standards for teaching materials.",3
1957,Process Mining: Data science in Action by Eindhoven University of Technology,Andrei I,"Feb 27, 2019","I took the course to extend my knowledge of data mining and to apply it to a more business setting. I think the course does a great job to balance dry theoretical concepts (such as Petri Nets and other modelling notations) and business aspects (such as the holistic view of data and processes and the interpretation of results). 
When preparing for applying for a process mining research position I reviewed every lecture and got to understand even more some aspects that didn't resonate with me on first viewing. It also helped me to dive into some process mining papers in between (such as the papers recommended at the end of some lectures). The more you encouter some concepts explained and used in different ways, the better you understand them.

Professor Wil van der Aalst is truly a Guru in the field and his team must be complemented for conducting such a useful course  on Coursera. The only note of caution is the course is challenging and it takes quite a bit of effort to learn the concepts and successfully complete the quiz.

The subject matter is not trivial - I often feel the need to re-read material in the accompanying text book, and it's taking me many weeks to find the time to complete this course. The videos, in my view, are too long. This means that there should probably be twice as many videos (they should not be longer than 10 min), or some of the material ought to be left out - mostly foundational stuff.

Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund. ",3
2206,The Power of Statistics by Google,John E,"Apr 26, 2023","The materials and presentations are excellent, but I am not a fan of the busy work involved in the end of course PACE portfolio work. Professional presentation is certainly important, but you end up diluting the course by including so much of this material. Furthermore, having worked on many projects, I can tell you that the workflow process is so iterative that trying to ""shoe horn"" the process into a four letter acronym -- which is better than the six letter acronym in the previous specialization -- is both reductionistic and frankly artificial.  My suggestions are as follows: remove this excess material and ""re-factor"" the PACE/portfolio material into one course, perhaps the capstone course. Otherwise, I learned quite a bit.",5

In the videos the tutor can be placed in the upper left corner and the rest of the screen can be used for visual learning. It is not necessary to look at the tutor all the time.

2211,The Power of Statistics by Google,James K,"May 10, 2023","I studied statistics years ago and I had forgotten almost all of it.  Unlike my old courses though, this course was excellent in that I could see an immediate application for everything I learned.
I covered things broadly so I could do with more practice, but that is my fault because the course is designed so that you can learn things at the level you want to understand them at.  There is ample practice, guidance and links to get really comfortable with both Python and, as the name suggests, the application of statistics to gain meaningful insights.  I will revisit the material if I get an opportunity to perform detailed analysis, because there is still room for me to learn a lot more
It was also a very enjoyable course",5

This is the best lecture i have ever received in my entire life and i thank  Google and Coursera for bringing such a talented man full of  knowledge of the topic.
At the end of Week 4, i saw an Ai pop up that says 51% of people that takes this test didnt pass it as first, i smiled and said not me that paid keen attention and interest to the lecture. I pass at first instance with over 80%.
I have to conclude without mincing words that the Caption THE POWER  OF STATISTICS is an appropriate coinage for the course and anyone who wants to be grounded in Data analytics must chew and drink this course.

The end-of-course project was a great opportunity to apply the newly acquired knowledge in a practical setting. This course has significantly strengthened my understanding of statistics and its pivotal role in data analysis.

2307,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Shelley,"Feb 26, 2019",I am amazed that IBM even put this course out on Coursera. It is the worst course I have come across. It is a humongous waste of time. It supposedly introduces the IBM Watson Studio but ALL the videos are outdated and do not reflect the platform currently on IBM's website. It is impossible to follow the instructions. You just have to sign up to the platform and hobble along trying to make sense of it. The quizzes were a utter waste of time. They don't even reflect the content in the videos. Many of the questions had topics that were not even covered. I was unable to do the final assignment because it's impossible to get to the Jupyter notebooks page when you sign in. It was an incredibly frustrating experience. I wasn't alone - the discussion forums are filled with hundreds of comments on the same issue - not being able to find the webpage where they need to create a notebook and do the assignment. I did not see any of the moderators even bothering to reply. Why have you put this course out here if you have no interest in providing quality content or help when your content is utterly outdated. I question IBM's reputation. This is a shambles of a course that I actually paid for (still paying since they changed it to a monthly debit!). I am in two minds whether to even continue with this certificate - seems ,1
2308,Tools for Data Science by IBM,DD,"Aug 1, 2019","                  YOU LEARN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! One star it's even too much. You learn how to make accounts on the IBM's proprietary platform so that you can pay one day (there is a monthly limit about the stuff you can do and if you don’t pay you are screwed). Giving away all your private data, of course. A platform that for free gives you the computing power of a 15 years old machine (with many other drawbacks). Jupyter Notebooks, R, Scala, it's all out there without Watson Studio, you could have installed Anaconda for example with all the beauty and speed of your personal machine (who doesn't have at least a dual core nowadays?). Without considering that would have been a lot more useful. So, you will learn only which open source tools you could use, but they send you on a proprietary platform to do that, without teaching you anything about those tools. Wait, they ask you to write 1 + 1 on python when you take the exam, you are all set with data science. This is a shame!    ",1

2314,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Georgi K,"Aug 21, 2020"," [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for each course]
I signed up for the IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it anymore. Here’s why:
1. First and foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me but whatever, lets move on.
2. The in-video quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are expected to have memorized content word by word rather than understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.
3. The final assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.
4. We eventually got to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.
5. And my final and biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality content.
6. Now after finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly filled in basically letting them know their specialization if terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfb
I was very saddened by the quality of the specialization and the content and was wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting next week.
In conclusion, I got this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their courses.  ",1
2315,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Cédric M G,"Aug 15, 2020","This course is an absolute catastrophe and I look forward to moving on to the next one. 
The first 2 weeks are a giant collection of endless software lists. Rather, I would have liked to see a disciplined presentation of the data science process itself (aka Course 3 of the certificate) and then only the softwares. The only useful piece is the chart presenting the steps of the data process. The rest is purely inadequate at this stage, I am sorry. 
The course jumps back and forth from the very easy/trivial to the downright specific/complicated without any inbetween. Why mention Kubernetes, gateways, runtimes, PMML and other endless jargon when people don't have a clue where these fit in the bigger picture ? Instead of presenting 68 different softwares and acronyms, I believe it would be more valuable to present Jupyter Notebooks properly, from scratch and focusing on its foundational features. That would be 2-3 hours well invested. 
One last note: the ""Free Python 3.6"" environment (using zero machine unit) is not available anymore. I had to create a separate environment manually, with 1 CPU and 4Gb RAM (using 0.5 u/hour) as a second best alternative. ",1

You will see, if you search the internet, many other tutorials exist which actually provide feedback in real time..especially for working in R.  I come to this course with no prior computer programming experience which is likely the reason I have struggled and been so lost. This was promoted as a beginner course but you will see, if you go through the lessons yourself, as if you were a new learner, that suppositions have made about the learner possessing prior knowledge to succeed in this course.  If you read the discussion Forum you will see several people expressing surprise that IBM is associated with a course this poorly organized and supported. I was excited to learn about the many Open Source Tools available for Data Science, and did appreciate the exposure to Watson Studio.

Mini-quizzes pop up during videos asking questions on content which hasn't yet been covered.  The labs are vague and make little sense, and then to top it off, Week 3 has a lab and video tutorial for a totally outdated version of Watson Studio which looks nothing like the current version and is impossible to follow along with.

A more apt name for the course is ""An outdated advertisement to IBM tools for data science"". Why do I suddenly mention outdated? Because the videos, labs, and readings use the IBM skills academy website as is at least a year outdated, the tools they use (specifically adding data to the skills lab) are no longer available, and the instructors have done nothing about this on the forums.

2337,Tools for Data Science by IBM,John G,"Feb 22, 2021","Poorly designed course.
Week 1: While the first section was ok, after the section on
“Data Science Tools”, it was more or less just a list of tools for data
science. I have 5 pages of notes that are mostly useless. The only reason I
wrote so much was that the quizzes often asked about such useless details, that
I learned to write more than I usually would. Whoever designed the course/tests
obviously has no real teaching experience. In addition, do not expect any
feedback from the quizzes. There is no attempt to help the learner learn from
wrong answers.
The quality of most of the “instruction” was poor. The woman
reading the script often did not logically pause when a slide was changed or
more information was added to the slide, as if she didn’t know what was on them.
For most of it, it was just a PowerPoint presentation. For IBM being so
advanced with technology, it seems for most of the teaching they simply used
20-year-old technology to demonstrate some of the most advanced technology that
currently exists. ☹ At
least they could have used a split screen to show a person AND text/screen
shots.
Week 2: Better information. Same woman reading slides…who is
not convincing that she actually understood what she was actually reading.
However, the information was more useful and the tools introduced were better.
Now I’m registered on some sites and we’ll see how useful that is.
Week 3: A big mix. Again lots of tools. Different people
speaking, but again they are just PowerPoint slides with no interaction with
people (unlike in the first course in the program). When there are screen captures,
sometimes they just jump and it is difficult to follow as they are quite quick.
Often the screen shots don’t have high enough resolution, so many of the tabs
in the programs are either difficult or impossible to read, or they don’t

it gets from one place to another.
Sometimes poor English pronunciation. Why doesn’t the person

kind of output. Unfortunately, many of the things that you have to do are not
actually taught in the course and you have to use other sources to find out how
to do things.",2
2338,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Josias B N,"Nov 27, 2020","I have done a few courses online and this is by far the worst I've ever encountered. The structure, contents and even the audio (sometimes impossible to understand without subtitles) were very below average. I never thought IBM would offer such a product. To make it short, I had the impression they put together a few videos from IBM trying to promote its products. And to make things even worse, the tool provided by Coursera (IBM product) was a let down. Slow, many times it didn't load, confusing to find your way around. Very, very disappointed with this course.  For me it felt like a waste of my time and made me feel frustrated. I would strongly recommend NOT TO TAKE THIS COURSE.",1

Information and teaching method was unorganized and jumbled, seemed like it was cut and pasted from previous versions, and left out all the context of the original.

This was frustrating for me because I am new to the field and everything in the class was foreign.  Also, it often felt like so many tools were being  introduced to balance out the focus on IBM.  This had the effect of making the class feel cluttered with information and didn't really diminish the overall feeling that the class is an IBM marketing product.

I have 3 main issues with how this course was handled.
1. Contents are outdated: As many people commented in the discussion forums and reviews, some of the contents regarding Watson studio is outdated, as the website went through updates. Instructions are not to be trusted in such cases, and it was difficult to navigate the course.

2. Full of Watson studio propaganda(ish): When going into this course, I was not expecting nearly half of the content to be focused around IBM's own platform. Seems a bit biased towards its own product, and I felt a bit annoyed with this.
3. Content is incredibly easy/ shallow: Completing this course proves almost nothing about your abilities for knowing tools for data science. It merely scratches the surface of the tools involved-- for example I really don't need this course to teach me how to create a markdown cell in Jupyter. If you are a college student or a working professional, this is something you can teach yourself through Google. It could be good as an introductory course for high schoolers interested in Data Science. (I felt like, personally, it was more about how to use IBM's Watson studio, and what IBM offers, more than learning about Data Science)",2
2352,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Reed M,"Dec 20, 2020","Not a very good course at all. Part of it is dedicated to memorizing the names of a bunch of data science tools for tasks that are defined in one or two sentences. Much of the rest is dedicated to basic-to-the-point-of-triviality ""Hello world"" style tutorials for Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and IBM Watson Studio. Speaking of the latter, there's a disproportionate emphasis on IBM products - a bunch of advertising that IBM will help your data science workflow, directed towards learners who have never experienced that workflow at all. Even as advertising, it's bad advertising. And how is it that we've gone through two courses and still haven't learned anything of substance about programming or math? I learned a few new bits and pieces of Markdown from the final project, but that's about all I'll retain from this course.
This course convinced me to jump ship from the IBM data science professional certificate path. It's possible that things get better later on, in the courses with actual substance, but I'm not going to bet $40+ on that possibility.",2

It's so obvious even just looking at the quizzes, 3 questions each on the open source tools quizzes and 10+ questions on each of the quizzes for the IBM products. The quizzes, by the way, are awful. I find myself having to write down everything that's said in the videos to do well on the quizzes because we're being tested on whether or not every little thing is memorized. I would prefer to focus on the overarching concepts and focus on the tools I know I'm going to need (Python, R, SQL) rather than IBM products. The construction of the quizzes really takes away from learning everything else because you have to pass the quizzes to get the certificate so you have to focus on that content instead of what's useful to you.",2

2357,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Robert H,"Nov 4, 2020","A real disappointment, one of the worst courses. I don't believe IBM has released anything like that.
week 1 - introduction to Python, R and SQL are pretty good and interesting; second part is about other data science tools which is just a confusing list of tens of different programs without any further information thus you will hardly remember anything; the last part is a strange mix of technical details again with hardly any benefit and confusing for people without IT background
week 2 - here comes the best :-(
no clear structure; totally ignores the skills of learners 
does not introduce the basic concepts but dives into technical details like a command shell
presenter uses tools that have never been introduced (Anaconda)
video is cropped so that you do not see which menu is clicked at the top
you are asked to use tools but no info about how to launch them
included scripts run into partial errors - there is no explanation in the videos whether it is OK or NOK
videos are recorded in a car as if this were a FaceBook motivation video, with the appropriate noise of cars in the background
quizzes asking questions that will be discussed far later (if at all)
presenter asking you for giving starts on GitHub for his terrific work :-)
hands-on lab is just like “copy this looong script and it will draw a map” - uff - and what does it give the student...
Sum up - week 2 is a total waste of time. You can learn this anywhere else and much faster. This part just disgraces IBM.
week 3 - well structured and interesting, if you accept that it is mainly promotion of IBMs products; and not much information is included; when there is something interesting (data refinery) it is so fast and misses further explanation, so that you will be lost again; btw - subtitles not matching the video :-(

2358,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Hakki K,"Jul 9, 2020","Hi,
I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.

In the first week you get bombarded with several dozens of names of tools without having the slightest clue what they do and why you should know them. What is the educational purpose of this?
The second and third week is basically one IBM tool advertisement after the other. Really, Coursera?
But what really appalled me is that you are told that you get access to IBM Watson Studio for free - and then you are asked for your Credit Card Information. Without giving that information I was not able to use Watson Studio - which is necessary to really follow through on the Course content.

Someone in IBM needs to go through this course and check how it matches with IBM Watson menus and screenshots.
The difference in menus and screens may be because IBM updated the software but no one checked and updated the course. The course say it is for anyone with no experience, I do not think that is true, when things do not work per the instructions or video it is going to be hard for a new person to figure out how to correct there steps, it took me 3 days to figure out how to do the quiz.

Why would THEY need to take this course?

Once you finally process all that information, take copious notes, and do a ton more online research, then there are some good introductions to Jupyter Notebooks, R studio, and github that are very easy to follow.

Overall, there are some people from IBM who contributed to this course and did a good job, but others who just ""turned in the assignment last minute"" without really having an idea or concept of ""how to teach"". 

This course should have had more examples of REAL use cases. They should really learn from Microsoft Azure's training videos that have real people, real data scientists talking about real use cases in the REAL world, instead of having a voice over actor read some dense material, they should really be interviewing experts.

Many of the questions on the quizzes don't ask for actual knowledge, they just ask for knowing the correct names of different products. Questions are sometimes worded vaguely and almost impossible to answer (e.g. asking an ""either or"" question and then offering only ""Yes"" or ""No"" as the choices).
Finally, the final assignment was a joke. They require you to take, save and then upload eleven individual screenshots of individual cells in a Jupyter notebook. This takes forever and it's completely unnecessary since you also provide the entire notebook in a public GitHub repo. It's just a waste of time and disrespectful of the learner. They also don't make it clear whether you should screenshot the cells as raw code, or after they are executed.

This course exists almost entirely to funnel users into IBM’s expensive IBM Cloud suite. You CANNOT complete the course and get the certificate without signing up to it. From what I can gather this used to be offered free to all students but that is no longer the case. I spent 3 days trying to create an account, and sent a number of emails and forums posts but with no luck. 
The support lines are completely useless. Once you sign up and go to the forums you will see thousands of angry users asking for access to the IBM Cloud suite and the moderators just ignore them. I trying signing up using the paid version but that didn’t work. When I queried with IBM, they responded telling me there was nothing they can do and that they will not allow me to sign up to their platform. Thus it is impossible for me to complete the course.
Aside from that the course quality is very poor, with outdated materials (all of with are either walls of text or powerpoint presentations) and endless lists that you are expected to memorise, rather than actually being required to understand the content. I had to watch most videos multiple times because I drifted off during them.
I expected more from Coursera and IBM. Will avoid this platform in future. I feel like I wasted weeks of my life on this course.

2406,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Hoseok Y,"Dec 5, 2020","I'm very disappointed by these courses. I'm not sure if the other courses are going to be similar but so far the courses has been filled with unexplained jargon and lessons where the instructor is working on a dataset that isn't provided in advance. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be finding these datasets on my own before but I have no idea where to find the exact dataset the instructors are using.
From my understanding, these are supposed to be introductory courses which should mean that they take the time teach you on a granular level about what they are talking about. Instead, instructors teach as if you should already know the technical terms and don't explain anything. They walk you through what you're supposed to do without explaining the reasoning or what the process is achieving. It feels like they don't really care about the depth of the education. 
Feeling kind of ripped off. I really hope that the rest of the courses are not like the first two courses. ",1
2407,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Aarushi S,"Mar 24, 2020","I appreciate the efforts that were put together in the course, and I have had very good experience with IBM courses in the past. However, was a bit disappointed with this one. The videos for IBM Watson Lab were outdated, which resulted in a lot of wastage of time to submit the final assignment*. Also, it does not make sense for students to compulsory learn IBM software and use it for assignments. Basically had to learn an extra software which we did not even sign up for. As part of IBM professional certificate, I think it was a bit redundant and can easily be made part of a Python beginner or Data Science beginner course. 
*Faculty were helpful to point this out and point a step by step procedure for the updated version. But this was in the discussion section, and also immediately makes having watched the videos completely futile. ",1
2408,Tools for Data Science by IBM,Carlo P,"Aug 31, 2020","The worst course of the IBM Data Science Certificate. It does not have the typical quality standards of an IBM course:
- The explanation is very poor, disorganised and very below IBM qualities (even below basic standards)
- Some videos have terrible audio because they are made in the instructor's car
- The teaching lacks consistency and logic: for example, (1) the instructor uses SHH keys but he explains how to make an SHH Key only 2 videos after (he says ""I'll tell you how do it later""...); (2) Staging is not mentioned during the videos, but it is requested during the test for week 2 GitHub.
- The instructor takes way too many things for granted.
- Too many topics done in a very superficial way

They are not intuitive either. There's no way those tools are used in professional environments.

There's a sad chance that many will get discouraged/pushed away from Data Analytics because of this R course though.

2434,Data Analysis with R Programming by Google,Jeff S,"Sep 22, 2021","This course was where my interest in the entire specialization started to wane. Whereas I flew through the first few courses, eagerly watching videos well into the night, exploring every supplemental reading, and participating in discussions, I had to force myself to stay focused and finish this course. The instructor has little no no personality, and I felt absolutely no connection with her whatsoever.

As far as the content itself, I finished the course with almost a type of resnetment for the R language. I know Google didn't create the language, and my opinions of the language can't be related to this course, but it t is an ugly language, that isn't fun to learn. To me, R is much more complex than it needs to be, and it was difficult to learn. There is little regard to consistant or logical syntax. For example, in most programming languages you make an array typing something like ""array_example = (1,2,3,4)"" but in R you would need to include the letter c, like ""array_example <- c(1,2,3,4). Even using the '=' doesn't follow traditional programming practices, you don't use it to assign variables. Also, some keywords in R are required to be capitalized, while others aren't, for what seems like no reason. When you use packages, you need quotes around the name to install it, but not when you load it, etc.

I also feel there was very little that was actually ""taught"" in this course. There were times in which I felt a topic wasn't explained enough, and other times where I felt like the instructor was repeating the same information over and over on the most basic things. The labs were pretty useless. Some of them were literally just opening the program, typing a command and looking at the screen. Very little insight into anything.

If the instructor did a better job presenting the material, perhaps it would be easier for me to get past these issues I had with learning R. I think if Google feels that learning R is important enough to dedicate an entire course, than it should have been presented better. Otherwise the entire course should be eliminated, or incorporates into a new course that introduces various other software used to analyze data.",2

At the same time, some very important aspects of R were either glossed over or not well-explained (pipes, I'm looking at you), and later portions of the course felt as if someone had taken the correct order of lessons and randomly jumbled them. Earlier lessons would ask questions that I didn't know the answer to, and then I would find the answer two or three lessons later, in the exact format that had been asked.
Additionally, this course could have benefitted from significantly more hands-on, follow-the-presenter material, as well as clear indications of when we would need to have a file (for example) saved from an earlier lesson in order to use in a later lesson. This happened several times, and I was usually left in the cold without anything to use to follow along. The presenter also sometimes skipped steps in her explanation, leaving me uncertain how to replicate the results she got.

As part of the data science team at Gourmet Analytics, you use data analytics to advise companies in the food industry. You clean, organize, and visualize data to arrive at insights that will benefit your clients. As a member of a collaborative team, sharing your analysis with others is an important part of your job. 
Your current client is Chocolate and Tea, an up-and-coming chain of cafes. 
The eatery combines an extensive menu of fine teas with chocolate bars from around the world. Their diverse selection includes everything from plantain milk chocolate, to tangerine white chocolate, to dark chocolate with pistachio and fig. The encyclopedic list of chocolate bars is the basis of Chocolate and Tea’s brand appeal. Chocolate bar sales are the main driver of revenue. 
Chocolate and Tea aims to serve chocolate bars that are highly rated by professional critics. They also continually adjust the menu to make sure it reflects the global diversity of chocolate production. The management team regularly updates the chocolate bar list in order to align with the latest ratings and to ensure that the list contains bars from a variety of countries. 
They’ve asked you to collect and analyze data on the latest chocolate ratings. In particular, they’d like to know which countries produce the highest-rated bars of super dark chocolate (a high percentage of cocoa). This data will help them create their next chocolate bar menu. 
Your team has received a dataset that features the latest ratings for thousands of chocolates from around the world. Click

2516,Data Analysis with R Programming by Google,Raphaella K G,"Oct 14, 2023","This must be one of the most challenging courses I've taken in this program! Not only was I a total newbie to programming languages, but I also had to rethink the way I look at data analytics as well. I always thought that data analysis only involved processing, cleaning, and analyzing the data, it never occurred to me that programming languages are involved as well.

Even though it was really challenging, I really had fun learning to code, especially when it already got to coding my data viz. I realized that there are completely different tools analysts can use to achieve the same results. I am now more open and excited to learn other tools for analysis well beyond this program. 

The way this course was structured really helped a lot! It helped me ease into the new language, get to know it, and practice it with the activities. The hands-on activities are what I appreciate the most, not only did they guide me to what I needed to accomplish for that activity, but they also allowed me to use different functions and find out techniques I could use to make the code or my analysis more efficient.

Thank you so much for your hard work!",5
2517,Data Analysis with R Programming by Google,Josh W,"Oct 24, 2022","The main female instructor was fantastic.  The tools taught outstanding.   However, there are two parts that need a review.  The first is  the idea that hiring managers prefer candidates who challenge the corporate status quo with new ideas.  That may be soley with Google as  I have yet to meet one in the general private sector who did.  Most intereviewers are solely interested in what the candidate can produce for the firm at the time.  New ideas are not part of the picture until the ones immediately pressing on the firm are resolved.  The second  issue was with your 'bias' button as it relates to statistical analysis.  That error becamse the source of my capstone project.  You have confused bias for sampling error.   A store manager misjudging which film will sell well and over-ordering the wrong tapes is not a bias error but a sampling error.  It is the equivalent of saying that your car has a bias for steering left due to an underinflated tire.  That is a lean, not a bias.  
That said. my capstone project describes real bias that has been going on in the country for decades.     ",5
2518,Data Analysis with R Programming by Google,Atul G,"May 30, 2022","This course looks at how to use programming in R to perform all of the stages in the data analysis process, from preparing and processing data, to performing preliminary and advanced analysis, to finally sharing the findings with your audience. The steps are very clearly shown with the trainer guiding you at the right pace. There are plenty of opportunities to follow along as instructed and understand the techniques by doing them - this is a great way to learn how to code. Various resources are linked to at key stages allowing for further reading on core concepts and even keeping 'cheatsheets' on key R packages for future reference. The priniciple of ongoing learning is conveyed perfectly with the instructor acknowledging her own meandering journey as an analyst and as a coder. Finally, the use of R markdown to display the steps you've used in your analysis and to easily produce a final report or presentation is extremely valuable for me. I will definitely be going through this course several times as I practice using R now and in the future. Excellent course 10/10",5
2519,Data Analysis with R Programming by Google,Rick,"Jun 4, 2022","Excellent base knowledge for R programming aimed at data analysis delivered in an easy to follow manner and at a reasonable cost. The course not only gives the student a good start but also provides lots of accessible resources and tips to move from a novice R programmer towards mastery. Remarkably, everything worked, I write this because I have attempted to follow instructions for such things as downloading programming ide's in other online courses and found them outdated, not so here. Everything is current and up to date. I think any student with average grades in the past can work through this course, perhaps repeating sections at times, and find themselves fairly R proficient in a timely manner. Personally with two hours effort every morning while my pre-schooler was still asleep I was confidently coding in less than a month (while using an old outdated Chromebook I bought for $100, not necessary to invest thousands in a new computer).",5

I think this course would be great for an aspiring analyst with little to no experience or someone like me who is an experienced analyst wanting to learn R. You will get out of the course what you put into it. It's possible to get a rudimentary understanding of R by quickly completing only the required elements, but one thing that I appreciated is that the course points at a number of resources for further inquiry and study. You won't leave this 5 week course an expert, but there is plenty here to launch one successfully. I'm impressed with how much I learned over the 5 weeks.",5

Based on my experience with grading assignments, the course participants exhibit a diverse range of knowledge, with a majority being new learners in data analysis. Occasionally, frustration may arise when fellow learners subjectively assess assignments due to limited understanding of the subject matter, language barriers, personal biases related to names or preconceived notions, and so on.
To address the potential biases mentioned in the latest part, I would recommend Coursera to consider anonymizing assignment submissions by displaying only initials instead of full names, just like  for the individuals assessing the assignments.

2735,Code Free Data Science by University of California San Diego,ALBERTO C C,"Apr 18, 2023","Es un curso muy básico para personas que no tengan experiencia en programación ni análisis de datos. Está estructurado en 4 módulos. El primero de ellos está orientado a mentalizar de la importancia del Big Data y las principales dificultades. El segundo de ellos permite iniciarse en la herramienta visual KNIME, en mi opinión lo más interesante del curso. El tercer módulo introduce conceptos de manipulación y visualización básicos (filtrar columnas, filas, recodificación de columnas, gráficos, etc.).  El último módulo introduce algunas técnicas de Machine Learning como árboles y K-means. 
En general me parece que algunos de los documentos (especialmente algunos del primer módulo) que recomienda leer son prescindibles y lo interesante de los mismos lo cuenta en los vídeos que son de menor duración y permiten un aprendizaje más eficiente. Tampoco están bien calibrados los tiempos estimados ya que una de las lecturas es un capítulo de 88 páginas de un libro y estima que se lee en 45 minutos.
Sólo lo recomendaría a alguien que no esté acostumbrado a tratar datos o el módulo 3 a alguien que quiera iniciarse en una herramienta visual que no necesite codificación.",3

Coming from a DS background, I was expecting a deeper context on medical data. For instance, I would have preferred to have examples with actual medical data, rather than out-of-context examples (e.g. how to make a moussaka dish). I understand that this is so that everyone can follow but since the course is rated as ""intermediate"" rather than ""beginner"" I was expecting it to be totally referring to medical data. I also had an issue with the quizzes - in any browser I tried (IE, mozilla, Microsoft Edge) the radio-buttons were not aligned with the actual choices, there were a lot of empty lines in between.

- It was useful to learn some keywords in data science. 
- helpful to play with basics of python.
- helpful to see how python helps manage data.
Cons: 
- it was distracting to see the lecturers in the video. It would have been helpful if they were just voice overs. It would have helped photographic memory if they replaced having themselves in the video with images of pathways, or even simple slides with words instead. 
- interviews with faculty members were interesting but were time-dependent. Meaning some of those projects are not longer operational due to lack of funding or other reasons. 
- The topics seemed disconnected and confusing. 
- the course objective was not unified and it seemed  disconnected themes wee merged into one course. One theme taught by each lecturer. ",2

I often had to go google the topic and read and take my own notes to be able to do the assignments or pass the tests.,2
2836,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Max W,"Apr 29, 2021","Many of the concepts mentioned in the lectures or the quizzes are never clearly defined. Quizzes test concepts never mentioned in class, and one question contradicts what was taught in class. ",2
2837,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Brandon H,"Sep 21, 2021","All IBM courses need to be removed from Coursera until they can fix them, and Coursera gets a promise that the INSTRUCTORS actually involve themselves in the forums. Anybody who paid for these courses should be refunded their money due to the extreme poor quality. I thought this IBM course would be different than the others, but they went right back into the speed through and not explaining the more complex topics again. The final project asks us to add titles to our statistical graphs, but this was never taught in either the videos or labs. The evaulation metrics are also mismatched with what the actual assignment states. This is 100% unacceptable.",1
2838,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Domenic P,"May 19, 2022","I really enjoyed the course. However, one has to keep in mind that the concepts presented are very basic.
for example, regression is a highly complicated topic and interpretation of the results needs more in depth analysis, however, for an introductory look into the topic the course is very well structured",5
2839,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Ebenezer D,"Nov 20, 2020",Excellent course to help clear doubts for the level of statistics needed for data science. It a great experience.  well done IBM!,5
2840,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Pritesh V,"Aug 25, 2022","Being a Mechanical Engineer, I already knew Normal Distribution but don't know the T-test, ANOVA, etc. This course covers pretty much about doing statistics using Python but you should know statistics before doing this course.  The course is great it also help you learn a bit of Seaborn visualization library.
I would recommend to do some course on Statistics first then do this course for implementing statistics in Python.
The Quiz, Assignment and Lectures were good. Only thing which was bad was it didn't explain the value we got in the summary of results of statistical tests we performed. Also the explaination was very brief.",4
2841,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Heinz D,"Feb 7, 2021","Good course, many subjects are covered. But be careful if you're totally new to statistics and hypothesis testing, this course is rather fit as a refresher. 
Unfortunately the lecture slides are not available for download and some of the transcripts need serious amendments. In all Jupyter labs the kernel did not connect for a long time and attempts to export notebooks as pdf threw internal server errors. Such things are disturbing and could be prevented with proper monitoring and proper technical setup. The peer review in week 6 must be performed without having the approved solutions; this is not very professional.",4
2842,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Andreas F,"Feb 22, 2021","Overall, the course gave me a brief but informative look at the basics of statistics with Python. Once again, the many practical exercises were very nice. However, the speed of the p-value and regression was a bit too ambitious for me. Would have appreciated some more details there or a good link to somewhat short and informative. But as said, overall, another very informative course.",4
2843,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Rob S,"Apr 7, 2021","The videos, readings, and labs were not sufficient for me to feel 
prepared for the assessments. I ended up using outside resources just to
 understand what was being presented here.",4
2844,Statistics for Data Science with Python by IBM,Daiga S,"May 31, 2023","I did not like this course.
1. Neither Statistics nor Python bits of it are properly explained
2. What get's presented in videos does not always go together with what is then asked in tests and labs
3. Some of the videos are quite incoherent
4. To this day I have no idea if in my final assessment (peer-graded) I used all the correct methods and arrived at correct conclusions. No way to verify if obtained values actually matched expected outcome. Sure I presented something and arrived at conclusions based on what I had fed Python but was it correct?
5. Some evaluation criteria for evaluating peers did not match what was asked during the task. 
Overall I felt it was quite messy and statistics concepts as well as python code were not nicely explained or working together. ",3

I'm particuliarly thankful for the step by step labs and excercises available on IBM.   In some cases, the course materials don't seem to cover content that is included in the evaluations.  In those cases, I suggest to reference outside sources.   Also the experiences with IBM Cloud have been frustrating.  Partially becuase the environment is at times unavailable when needed.  In addtion the environment has been undergoing upgrades and changes, and the course materials are not up to date with the changes in the cloud environment.   Ultimately though, dealing with unstable computing environments and reasearching outside sources to successfully complete projects are skills possibly more valuable than knowing how to compute statistics with Python.

Also the lectures inside the specialization focused too much on math and too little on practice and on algorithms explanations.  It's good to have some idea about the math behind but I would have rather preferred working with python machine learning and NLP stuff than with creating math functions from scratch in python considering it already has its own libraries to do them. Also the explanations were not that perfect and a better English speaking teachers would be appreciated.

I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.
May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.

2999,Data Science in Real Life by Johns Hopkins University,Sandip M,"Aug 20, 2017",A very good and concise course that helps to understand the basics of the Data Science and its applications. The examples are very relevant and helps to understand the topic easily.,5
3000,Data Science in Real Life by Johns Hopkins University,Elliot S,"Nov 13, 2017",Highly educational course on the realities of data analysis. Many good tips for your own analyses as well as for managing others responsible for coherent and accurate analyses.,5
3001,Data Science in Real Life by Johns Hopkins University,Jason C,"Nov 7, 2018","I found this course to be notably worse than all of the others in the series. There is very very little practical content provided within the lectures. Way too many summaries or over-views of what's to come next without really getting into the nuances of what is discussed as a course topic. Way too much repetition of the exact same content, there is even repetition of content in this course that was presented in another one of the courses in the series. Many of the examples are purely meant as a comedic aside rather than actually functioning to discuss the topic with depth. E.g. - talking about statistical modeling and putting up a picture of Ben Stiller from Zoolander - then keeping the picture up there for the entire explanation. There's literally a Nic Cage example provided for the confounding factor lecture only for the instructor to say directly after ""This isn't actually the best example"" - then proceeds to not explain why it was brought up aside from mentioning there's a spurious correlation. Way too much repetition of similar examples - showing photos of a muscular v. skinny Christian Bale. This pop-culturey reference isn't needed in the first place and doesn't need to be shown in triplicate. I don't mind repetition if there is additional nuance or content provided through them, but that isn't the case in this course. I find there is too much focus on side tangents, where the instructor seems to change thoughts mid-sentence but forgets to come back to the original idea. I think that every single video could be cut down by 25%, purely by being more concise, and should include more nuanced descriptions. I found it particularly odd that instrumental variables were noted as a rather clever technique, yet an explanation was intentionally avoided, however an example was still provided. Bringing up a topic, intentionally refusing to define it, then providing an example directly after just doesn't make sense. I think that more time needs to be spent refining the lectures so that they're designed to teach content. It has the feel of someone who's talking about a field to get people interested in it rather than a practical training course. Many key terms are very poorly defined with examples (on many cases the audience is referred to wikipedia for explanations) in which the basics are repetitively explained while the nuances are glossed over. There seems to be an odd theme where summaries and over-generalizations are far too frequent and yet the key terms and how they relate to examples are an afterthought. I don't think the summaries are necessary given the fact that users can literally re-watch every single video and there isn't enough total content to justify a summary in the first place. Additionally, this course also seems to deviate from the others in that there is an assumption that the student has a heavy amount of programming experience already built in (or that's my assumption since many of the term explanations aren't discussed too heavily). Prior lectures break down the basics more and indicate that potential managers should pursue the data specialization courses. ",2

I didn't give it five stars because the workspace didn't seem to have enough cells to perform the tasks and there was no explanation of how to add more.  I figured it out, but it took some time and I had to rush through parts to finish before the deadline.  Also, the instructor's cursor sometimes covered a mark in the code so I had to wait for him to move it and then pause the video to complete the line of code, which again wasted time.  I wasn't able to complete all of the steps, but I passed the quiz, so I still got the certificate.

I didn't expect such a course on this platform.  This course does not teach anything about HR Analytics, If anybody wants to take this course to learn HR/People Analytics then take a U-turn. Simply because HR data used in this course won't make this an HR Analytics Course. Also, this is not even recommended to anybody who wants to learn anything about Power BI Dashboard. There are a thousand times better videos on YouTube for free, and maybe available on Coursera itself but some other course... not this one.

Apart from selecting one file and just modifying its font, BG color, and basic things like how to use the charts and graphs there was nothing useful for me. I feel like I watched a beginner's tutorial for PPT. There was no explanation for what is pbix format. There was even a moment when I realized the instructor didn't know or forgot the difference between visual heading and items to change the font color.

One cannot just go into a ""BI chat"" somewhere, and ask questions, if there are Materials missing, outdated, or incorrect to accomplish the real hands on project practices and end of course projects. Therefore, going into Course 3, my expectations are low. This was not the case for the Data Analytics certificate, but for Course 2 of this BI certificate.

3418,The Path to Insights: Data Models and Pipelines by Google,Erik H,"Nov 27, 2023","My main issue with this course, and why I'm giving two stars is because the Google Fiber end-of-course project is poorly developed and doesn't offer any challenge beyond what was already covered in the Google Data Analytics course. The tasks that we are asked to perform to complete it are wildly simple and don't match at all what was covered in the course. Downloading CSVs, manually uploading them into Big Query, merging them with some UNION ALL statements, and then downloading the resulting table is not a data pipeline. The project needs to be heavily developed or outright pulled from the course, as it's a major disappointment.

The rest of the course content was much higher quality, and gave me a lot of new concepts to consider for how to ensure data quality. Now, as to how we actually perform those data quality checks, schema validations, and actually set up a proper pipeline, that doesn't actually exist in this course.

3486,Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights by Google,Islands,"Dec 31, 2023","Although I have not completed this course by now and am halfway done, I feel extremely disappointed with this advanced course. 

In this advanced course, course 1 is the intro, and courses 2 and 3 discuss fundamental Python analysis and visualization using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. By viewing content, courses 4 - 6 are advanced Python analysis, such as Introduction to Machine Learning and Regression Analysis. 

Let's start talking about courses 2 and 3. They throw you everything, and you must figure it out alone. It's just like you haven't learned Allegra yet, and they throw you calculus staff. How can you learn how to run if you don't know how to walk? It feels like impossible. If you have no previous Python experience, don't take this course! It will keep and keep confusing you. 

Let's have an example by looking at course content. In course 3, they taught you data analysis, visualization, and data cleaning afterward. This does not make any sense. If you aren't familiar with data analysis yet, data analysis should follow the steps in order(the steps might differ, but the structure is the same): Ask questions, data collect, data clean, analyze, and visualize. They don't teach in order, which is ridiculous, in my opinion. 

I learned content similar to this course about two years ago and recently re-picked it up for review. But for sure, if you have yet to gain experience with Python, don't take this course; find something better, I promise. At least, it confused me more.",2

3548,Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights by Google,Carlos C,"Jan 18, 2024","Positive:
- The instructor is very clear in what he teaches and clearly explains when we're not supposed to know how to do things. 
- The parts that implement repetition in labs are extremely helpful and should be reinforced more. Having to convert things to datetime multiple times cements the structure a lot more easily. 
- Despite my criticisms (below) on the order information is presented at times, I do think I learned a lot. 

Negatives:

- Once again you go into labs and are asked to use tools you haven't learned. Why am I introduced to things after having to find what to use in a lab? Parts of the reference guide for Python in Module 3 for ""How to handle outliers"" should have been presented earlier in the course.  Some tools aren't taught at all and are expected to be found in the links to manuals provided throughout the lessons (which honestly are not very intuitive).
- The labs are where I learn the most, but it takes me a lot longer than 1hr as a person who is new to Python and programming in general. There should be more emphasis on these. If you want people to figure out a solution with tools that haven't been presented, you should clearly outline that in the instructions during the different steps of the lab. It is deflating to wrack your brain trying to find a solution and then learn that it was not in the tools you've been taught so far, but not being told whether you should have explored outside of your taught knowledge.
- During the Tableau presentation the instructor doesn't specify to change number of strikes to a dimension. It might be easy to miss the step.",4
3549,Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights by Google,prateek v,"Apr 7, 2024","The content is exceptional. Coding in Jupyter notebook is quite good. However, I do think a review of contents could be done. There are times instructor missed to emphasize on important things, had to find answers in discussion forum. There are multiple instances where the video slightly differs from follow along guide. 
At some places the indexing within modules doesn't make sense.
I preferred the previous Course where everything was much more organized. Where needed video would have a prompt to open follow along guide and navigate to specific section. Makes it much more convenient.
I hope someone from the team reviews the contents once and fix these issues",4
3550,Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights by Google,CHONG L,"Jun 1, 2023",The videos in this course are longer and harder to follow than the previous ones.

3625,Data Analysis Using Python by University of Pennsylvania,Richard C,"Sep 28, 2022","The course moves really fast.  You get a bunch of videos that are less than a minute long, with a few 2 minute ones in there.  You can blow through all of the video content in a module in a few minutes.  Then you get a quiz which is only difficult because you've only had ~4-5 minutes of time spent with the material (unless you watched the videos several times).  But you'll pass the quiz without too much difficulty because you can either rewatch videos to get the answers or just retake it until you pass.  I don't find that experience to be that useful.  
The programming assignments are frustrating because they are harder than any of the examples given and require you to know the material well enough to apply it to something else.  That's quite difficult because you have to use information that got less than a minute of attention in the course.  If you ever had a horrible experience in a math classroom because a teacher did one easy example on the board and then expected you to do far harder problems on the exam without really explaining how or why any of it works, you may find this course to feel like that.  I don't personally like this format for learning.  I also found the directions to be ambiguous in a few cases. 
The assignments also seem to be a bit buggy.  Putting aside the usual issues with Jupyter Notebooks that people run into (not running cells in the correct order, etc.), I find that I had tremendous difficulty with a few of the assignments and those issues were not with my code.  I would run the cells and have my answers get rejected.  After an hour of pulling out hair wondering how I was wrong, I'd walk away.  A few hours later, I'd open up the notebook again, run the EXACT same code, and the answers would be accepted.  There is nothing more annoying than having a correct answer get rejected and wasting hours wondering why it was wrong.   This doesn't seem to be an isolated experience--there are tons of people in the discussion forums posting about how their answers weren't accepted and they don't understand why, with the course staff replying that the answers were accepted.  
I don't want to be unfairly negative.  The production quality is good and the staff are reponsive in the forums.  I just think the course is weirdly hard for an introduction.  It's one of those introductory courses that sort of only works well if you already know the material already.  But then, why take the introductory course?   The course would be a lot better if they spaced it out and went slower.  I think the videos need to be longer with more examples.  That would allow people who don't ""just get it"" to not feel overwhelmed with the large amount of information while also allowing experienced people to just skip over that stuff if they don't need it.

3626,Data Analysis Using Python by University of Pennsylvania,Aayushi J,"May 6, 2021","Course was very good to learn pre-processing and visualization and also gives good practice. The questions in the homework exercises could be more clear as in what they are expecting as the output. The way it has been put out makes few exercises confusing for us to understand in order to solve them. Response by the teaching staff on the forum can be quicker, sometimes it's frustrating for the coder if they are stuck and we don't get response atleast in 12 hours. Right now it goes beyond 24 hours. ",3

3637,Data Analysis Using Python by University of Pennsylvania,Hüseyin C Ü,"Feb 25, 2021","Video lectures were split() into short fragments which I enjoyed very much. Brandon, the professor of the class is very much involved with the audience and he is not monotonous. This is a huge plus! The only point of improvement that I would like to mention is; in some assignments the ask could be more clear. However, this comes with a hidden advantage, it gets you researching the Python libraries/documents, and learn about more advanced topics with trial and error. This is not a class to just watch the lectures, if you like to do self-research and looking for a foundational class to build upon, don't miss it. Make sure to install pyCharm and Jupyter in your local machine to test your code more efficiently (he walks your through how to do that during the class). All in all, this is a high-quality class that deserves five stars, especially recommended for finance professionals.  ",5

The production quality was excellent - easy to listen to, ready to follow the slides, and the questions immediately followed each short segment. 
I would have preferred it if the Professor had gone through different examples of data scientist and data engineering resumes to show me what performers in each quintile look like and what signals distinguish members of each quintile from the higher or lower quintile.

3731,Building a Data Science Team by Johns Hopkins University,Astolfo,"Jun 28, 2020","Good content.
It explains very simple the things you will require if your are planning to create a team of data analytics.Like understaing the roles of analyst, engineer and manager, consider important factors as empowerment and control expectations of what data anlysis can achieve.
Just consider increasing the time for reading sessions, they usually take more than the 10min said, and having the more realistic time, help us to plann our study sessions.
Great course",5

3856,NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis by Coursera Project Network,Supamas N,"Sep 23, 2022","First of all, I would say the instructor is really great in explaination and project guidance.  In overall, the project is fantastic and easy to follow.  However, I found some obstacles that made me follow the project pretty much slower than I expected. I wish someone who responsible for this course could see my comment and improve these.
1.  Project was performed on Python which was installed on a server and we work through the Cloud Workspace which is great  because we don't need to install any software on our computer. However, the default folder did not set to the working folder. For those who are not familiar with Python, this might be the first big problem.
2.  The first and most important thing is the data collection. In the project we have two ready-to-use datasets. Again, for the beginners, we don't know how to get the data and how to rate them 0 or 1. Reality,  we could not analyte further if we couldn't get the proper dataset. So, this course will give us more benefit if it shows us how to grab the data and how to rate 0 or 1 on the posiitive/negative comments. If there is another lesson about this, you should inform us to take that course prior taking this one.
3. Cloud Workspace is always unstable and then it works quite slow, especially when we need to scroll up/down. 
Again, I appreciated the course in overall, but I suggested it need some improvement.  Less stars might  make the instructor pay more attention on the comment. Thank you.

Thank you for this! However, I cannot understand, why after completing the course a part of studying materials are not accessible, even though I paid a sufficient price for the course. These unaccessible materials include Python programs which were used as a practice. Frankly, I find it unfair, since this practice would be extremely important to revise the materials while improving my skills in Machine Learning in the future. Moreover, a part of the montly fee was paid also for the practice materials. I may agree that these Python programs can be private, however,there should be ways to overcome this issue. Without the possibility to revise the code it will be much harder to create our own applications and programs. ",1

The mathematics involved in the first course of this specialisation is not that difficult if you already have a solid foundation on calculus. Some functions used in the Optional Labs are called for you from already written python scripts (which you have access to, and can download to inspect). The first 3 weeks (and probably the rest of the course) will not teach you fundamentals on Python or mathematics or statistics, and some details regarding the choice of loss function for logistic regression were omitted. Furthermore, libraries such as scikit-learn were used to complement the material, but not explained in depth. (Granted, this course is not about Python libraries.)
All in all this seems like a great introduction to ML for people already comfortable with mathematics and Python.

However, I would've loved if there was more in-depth treatment for the Math aspects of the obtained results. Also, the assignments + Optional labs were not as engaging as I hoped. What I mean by that is, it almost required no deep thought from our side to implement the procedures. In other words, there was a lot of skeleton code that makes you ""implement"" the algorithms with almost no thought (which I don't think is beneficial to the student's learning experience)",3

3950,Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by DeepLearning.AI,Will S,"Dec 16, 2022","Pretty good introductory course! Personally, I would like to see more time devoted to the Scikit-Learn implementation (and maybe Pandas data frames instead of NumPy arrays for the training data) as opposed to hard-coding the algorithms and using really small data sets. Scaling upwards and using those libraries on larger data sets should be relatively easy after you nail the foundational concepts in this course, though. There is definitely something to be said about knowing the mathematical algorithms running in the background of these black box models, and this course does a really good job of explaining them (namely, cost functions and gradient descent).
Apart from scripting these algorithms in Python code, the course is somewhat lacking when it comes to conceptually explaining regression and classification models. For example, there is no time spent explaining how to interpret regression model coefficients and intercepts, and there is little time spent explaining the probabilistic interpretation of the sigmoid function and the importance of choosing a good decision boundary. It is one thing to know how to program these models and another thing to be able to explain them to people without a technical background, which I think could be a good lesson in future versions of the course.
Overall, great introduction to the models and their implementation in Python! I would absolutely recommend the ""optional"" labs throughout the course (especially if you're new to Python) because they show you the code that you'll have to write in the required assignments.",4

4008,Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by DeepLearning.AI,Scott W,"Dec 2, 2023","The course was marked as beginner level, and I think that is a correct characterization. I appreciated some of the deeper dives into the mathematical underpinnings, and felt they struck a good balance between showing some of the underlying math without making it the focus of the course.

I think I expected a bit more breadth in the coverage of different types of AI models and techniques - beyond just linear regression and logistic regression, which I wouldn't normally think of as AI models at all. But as someone with a lot of background in statistics but little knowledge of AI, I was interested to see the slightly different AI-flavored spin on these basic model types to discuss topics like gradient descent, feature engineering, regularization, and more that were new to me.

I would have appreciated a bit more in the way of Python instruction or guidance about resources for Python help, but they provided a lot of resources that I think will be helpful reference for writing my own code.

I might have been interested in one or two (optional) code exercises that would have forced me to walk through an analysis from start to finish as an opportunity to practice the actual implementation of these techniques - e.g. importing data, creating a simple plot, running a regression, using scikit-learn. But I also understand that this would have added to the number of hours required to complete the course, and I was very appreciative that it did not take too much time out of my day/week to complete all the material - as I do have a full-time job!

Andrew is a great lecturer, and did a great job explaining concepts clearly and presenting the material in an engaging and interesting way. I think this was the best part of the course.",5

In 3 weeks you can get a really great foundation on how supervised ML works with both mathematical- and python-based formulas/implementations. 
The lectures only require a minimal math background - about what you would learn as a college freshman.  I used Khan Academy in parallel when I needed a boost. Also - big help - you implement each formula / algorithm in Python code in a series of short, well-focused labs (with lots of pre-defined code). This re-expresses the math into Python code which helps get a concrete understanding of the logic (esp. if you're not a ""math person"")

There is some math, but it is presented in a completely accessible way. 
My main suggestion for improving this course would be to have more required labs and to do more scaffolding with respect to testing the student's knowledge of key concepts.

Provides a good balance of intuitive understanding and the math behind the concepts. 
I do wish the course were a little less gentle and went faster in places, delved into the math a little deeper (e.g., for logistic regression), the intuitiion in places a little deerp (e.g., regularization's impact on mean square cost) -- but, I perfectly understand the difficult tradeoffs that have to be made here to appeal to the broader audience.

If you want to learn how Machine Learning systems work and how we check if it is working fine or not, this course is the best. 
This course builds the mathematical ground and gives a visual support as well to understand the concepts better. One of the things I appreciated most about the course was the emphasis on understanding the intuition behind the models, rather than just memorizing formulas. This approach made it much easier to comprehend how the models work and how to choose the appropriate model for a given problem.

Moving the course to python was essential and it is good to see a lot of example notebooks with supplementary material in. I'd recommend students look at Geron's OReilly Book (Hands On Machine Learning ...) afterwards to see more coding examples in the book and associated github repo. One gripe was that you didn't make students do vectorised code for the two programming asignments. I commented out the example code in week 3 asignment and substituted vector code (which runs fast).",5

No matter where you stand right now, you come out as capable of applying the algo on real datasets. 

The course mostly about the application of regression, classification. No endless details or math theories and focus on the big picture. Very practical!

The coding assisngmnets and quizzes are very on point, and literally an application of the algorithm, with step by step guidance.

I already took  Andrew NGs ""Machine Learning"" course  a few years ago.
Taking it again (in Python this time) was a great refresher ! 
Although I understand the need to make the course more accessible I feel like the math was oversimplified at times( standard deviation, probabilities, core math functions).
Moreover I think the course should have covered EDA and feature selection before introducing supervised algorithms.
Finally, I was a bit dissapointed by the scikit learn optionnal lab, I expected more.

The concepts really flowed well together and it gave me a solid pattern of application. This was math heavy but you don't need any math pre-requisite to do any of it. The math is all explained and it is all derived for you with explanations for each step. There was coding in python but the coding examples were problems to show you how to code the actual algorithms and not anything else.

This time around they've upgraded to Python and gone lighter on matrix algebra, although there is still a section on vectorisation for those interested. Most of this first specialisation was revision for me so I sailed throuh it in a week. I found the jupyter notebooks a bit noisy, being a software engineer and not a data scientist, and tended to delete the skelton code implementations and replace them with the vectorised versions as I actually found this easier.

Andrew delivers on this, the most important outcome of a course.

The one problem I have is that they use terms like 'fairly big', and 'works almost all of the time' when explaining some topics or in the quizzes. I understand why they are doing this as it is a beginner ML course, but as a Math major myself I think it is bad practice. ML falls under applied mathematics so I think the choice of words in the course should be more rigorous as this will prevent any confusion later on for a learner. ",5

In this advanced course, course 1 is the intro, and courses 2 and 3 discuss fundamental Python analysis and visualization using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. By viewing content, courses 4 - 6 are advanced Python analysis, such as Introduction to Machine Learning and Regression Analysis. 

Let's start talking about courses 2 and 3. They throw you everything, and you must figure it out alone. It's just like you haven't learned Allegra yet, and they throw you calculus staff. How can you learn how to run if you don't know how to walk? It feels like impossible. If you have no previous Python experience, don't take this course! It will keep and keep confusing you. 

Let's have an example by looking at course content. In course 3, they taught you data analysis, visualization, and data cleaning afterward. This does not make any sense. If you aren't familiar with data analysis yet, data analysis should follow the steps in order(the steps might differ, but the structure is the same): Ask questions, data collect, data clean, analyze, and visualize. They don't teach in order, which is ridiculous, in my opinion.

NO formula is given. I did a class approximately equivalent to this one but there were so much formulas to understand and retain that it was hard to follow. I am not saying that those formulas are not good to know but just that with a correctly programmed statistical software which does all the calculations, the most important for professionnals on the floor seeking to validate hypothesis and find root cause is to know which to test to use, how to collect the data and how to interpret the results. And that is what this course does very well.

Regarding Minitab, not all of the students of this course are students at University, so not all are entitled to acquire an academic license of Minitab – an option that is effective and affordable. I graduated a long time ago, which means that a license fee of US$1800 is prohibitive.

I hope that we have more courses delivered by Dr. Inez in LSS and Data Science! As the course instructor; she is so engaging, and she has definitely invested so much time to design the material delivery pattern, and furthermore; the case studies and the questions are meticulously designed to give learners a coherent learning path. I also recommend following up using the Minitab software and the supplementary materials which are so helpful and right to the point for literally all of the practice cases. ",5

4316,Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone by Google,Konrad S,"Apr 21, 2023","Honestly, the course started very well. From segment 4 to 6, you exaggerated on the technicality and completely lost me. I have an engineering background and got absolutely bored halfway through.
On youtube there are channels that talk about these mathematical and statistical subjects in a very fun way, and easier to understand. These classes manage to get me more confused about topics I already was confident about.
Don't get me wrong, the course is interesting. It just conflicts with what you say when it comes to explaining something to stakeholders: make it simple, without complex terminology.
And I understand that statistics comes with complex terminology almost inevitably, but you did not manage to explain it in a simple way.
Too many examples with ""biology"" or random things that don't reflect on business scenarios. Only a few of them actually reflected the industry reality.",2

4411,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Janis S,"Mar 19, 2020","In general, this course is very useful and I have learned a lot.
But... 
A large amount of information has been compressed in a short period of time. The synthesized speech runs too fast. Slides on videos also change too fast. Some of them appear less than a second. A learner has to pause or even rewind a video to catch and explore them for understanding.
Multiple errors in lab solutions (I would call them even bugs). Some of the proposed solutions do not follow requirements specified in preceding cells.
Wrong information in slides. For example, 'hidden layers' instead of 'neurons in the hidden layer' or 'hidden neurons'.
Too many spelling errors in videos, quizzes and descriptions apparently made by non-native English speakers. For example, two instead of too, ture instead of true, supper instead of super, rergresstion instead of regression etc.
Technical issues with labs appear too often - cannot start the server or unavailable at all for multiple days, broken conda installation due to outdated or incompatible module versions (in particular, torchvision and pillow).

4433,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Mitchell L,"Jul 15, 2020","This course had many flaws including that at the most basic it was riddled with errors, typos, and formatting issues.
Some more specific feedback is that this course seemed overly preoccupied with explaining math concepts or neural net architecture at a high level and glossing over much of the actual pyTorch specific programming.
The organization of the lectures make no sense, with separate lectures and labs for single class and multiclass versions of various models even though the functions all were built to handle multiple dimensions and so there was really no difference. Additionally because the lectures, lab, and quiz used all the same examples this means we would see the exact material presented over and over with no clear pedagogical reason.
Additionally the course seemed overly preoccupied with OOP to the point of replicating the functionality of several built in pyTorch classes obfuscating the actual material with no clear reason given for why we were creating our own version of extant classes.
Lastly, the quizes almost never asked any questions about pyTorch. Most of them were just the most basic questions about comprehending reading code. Things like ""if input = 3 how many inputs are there?"" or ""which option is used for He initialization"" and the options are like ""He initialization or Xavier""",1

4464,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Roger S P M,"Apr 1, 2020","The course material contains some really fantastic information, graphics, and programming assignments. However, the presentation of this material is absolutely terrible! It seems they intentionally tried to make the presentations as boring as possible. The lectures are monotone, the 15 second opening scene is annoying, and the content focuses 70% on the concepts of Deep Learning (which is fine) and 30% on PyTorch. So when you finish you do not feel very skilled with PyTorch. 
Finally, ALL of the student complain that the programming environment is very often offline. You cannot do many of the assignments because the ""Cognitive Classroom"" is usually not working. However, the last lecture f each week contains the Jupyter notebooks for the assignments. You can download and then run them in some other environment like Google Colaboratory or IBM Watson Cloud. Also, most of the programs contain a programming omission that the students have to fix every time. The instructors have not fixed the problem which has been reported to them. So pay attention for the ""Pillow Error"" in Week 3 because you will be fixing it yourself in most assignments for the next 4 weeks. ",2

One thing about this  course is that some important topics like RNN, R-CNN , text and sentiment analysis, time series are not included in this course which I think should be included.",4
4481,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Juho H,"May 6, 2020","This course is difficult to rate as a learning experience. There are some very good parts yet there is also some very poor material. I would say that if you are already very familiar with machine learning and Python BEFORE taking this course, you can still draw some useful learnings on how PyTorch can be applied to various problems, and how to create convolutional neural networks with it; but if you are uncertain about some of the key concepts, this course may only end up making things worse for you.
To give an idea of the problems, there are issues like: 
- When explaining the train/validation/test data logic and how validation data can be used to prevent overfitting, the videos keep calling training data test data. 
- Pytorch is used for some really fancy stuff like defining functions and datasets, but then those functions are not parametrized in any sensible way – meaning if you want to compare loss functions from two different initialisations of the model weights, you are expected to define a new function so you can just change the variable “LOSS” to “LOSS2”, rather than just passing the loss function as a parameter or just initializing or returning it. Given the Pytorch logic is not your regular Python stuff, a best practice should be provided – it is definitely not writing a new function every time. 
So be warned: if you know what you are doing, and simply want to learn how to do it with Pytorch, this may still be a decent course for you, just ignore all the stuff where the instructors make mistakes (and they are plenty, also in incorrect quiz answers). But if you feel at all uncertain, I suggest you hone your machine learning skills elsewhere, because otherwise this course will leave you totally confounded on even the very basics of machine learning.
On the upside then, you learn Pytorch through repetition. In the beginning, the logic appears very intimidating, but then you gradually learn the logic and you can do some very impressive stuff quite easily in the end. Be prepared for the amount of repetition, however - first the stuff is shown on a video, then you run the exactly same stuff in a lab, and unfortunately the Skills Lab is not at all efficient for some of the stuff - I ended up downloading the notebooks and using them on my Watson Studio account for much faster performance.",2
4482,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Daan S,"Nov 19, 2021","To be honest I am severely disappointed by the quality of the course. Nearly every single video contained typos and the example code often lacked consistency through weeks. For example, one week batch normalization was applied before activation, while the next week it was applied after activation. Without even elaborating on such changes, this threw me off as I am now unsure how to apply it. Furthermore, the labs barely presented any actual practice. In 9/10 cases I could just run all the code without implementing anything myself, this definitely decreased the learning experience. In addition, the quizzes don't provide any challenge at all. You can easily complete most quizzes without even watching the lectures as the answer is often already provided in the question itself. The last thing I would like to mention is that the staff in the discussion forums, although friendly, is clearly lacking fluency in English. They often don't seem to grasp the question and provide a copy-paste solution to most cases. Whether it's Deep Learning or PyTorch you want to learn, you're much better off following a course by a different provider on Coursera.",2
4483,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Lennart F,"Sep 28, 2021","The video's are voiced by a robot. There is alot of information, but the quiz questions are so simple that you get the feeling they are aimed at 6-year olds (e.g. most times you just have to repeat what the robot voice has JUST said). The peer review system for the honors assignment is retarded: I failed this assignment while answering everything correctly, just because some dude accidentaly misgraded a question. Coursera now expects me to pay another 40 euros to resubmit the assignment just because someone else messed this up, lol. Take your courses elsewhere.",2
4484,Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch by IBM,Marcin L,"May 1, 2020","Practice sessions are organized in a tool that doesn't have enough computing power for training neural networks.

It's hard to understand as it all runs at the same pace and there isn't sufficient time given to specific concepts that may take a shorter or a longer time to sink in depending on their complexity. It's just a constant speed monologue without any real feeling or passion in the subject matter. ",1

Example for week 1, I think 1.1 (introduction to tensors), 1.2 (1d tensors) and 1.3 (2d tensors) can be combined to single lecture or all 3 lectures be one after another making it appear like it’s together. The 2 labs can be combined into a single notebook. The 2 quizzes can be combined into 1 quiz of maybe 5 or more questions. Similarly, 1.4 (Simple Datasets) and 1.5 (Datasets) can be combined, and so on. I also think that the honours content about batch normalization should be included as part of normal contents.

4543,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Caesar H,"May 28, 2020","Overall, this course was very interesting and the organization made sense. However, if you are looking for a deep understanding of computational neuroscience as a computational novice, this course is much more advanced than they make it seem in the overview and it will not help. Conceptually, I feel I learned a lot, but practically, I still have no idea how to implement solutions. It is a must (not a bonus) to know MATLAB or Python coding. It is a must (not a bonus) to know calculus (definitely derivations, integrations, and limits in detail). The TA videos were one of the best parts of the course, but there is very little to no support if you are stuck with questions (the forums were not very helpful; get yourself a tutor in real-time). The biggest issue I have with this course is the lack of practice problems. I would suggest that at the end of each lesson, a few practice problems are given with full solution explanations. Then, a set of a couple of practice problems should be given to solve (with detailed solutions at the completion of the homework). Not until this practice and training are implemented should there be a quiz. The quizzes were the worst part of the course. They happen at the end of each week's lessons, and there are no real explanations for each solution. The forum isn't very helpful because it's a quiz, and they don't want to give out answers (understandably so). Therefore, a practice set should happen after each lesson but before taking the quiz.",2
4544,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Amy S,"Jun 24, 2020","Absolutely wonderful. It should be mentioned immediately for any readers who are interested in taking this course: While the course is itself ""Introductory"" and requires no background knowledge, a student with absolutely no exposure to introductory probability (Bayes theorem), programming concepts, problem-solving and differential equations may struggle with some of the more abstract concepts in the course. With that said, the rest of this review will describe my experience having taken this course with quite bit of prior work in Python, very little introductory knowledge of Calculus, and absolutely no exposure whatsoever to neuroscience or basic biology.
I was initially interested in taking this course to gain a deeper insight into some of the concepts I was introduced to on my regular visits with a neurostimulator patient at a local hospital. I am anything but disappointed by this course and feel that goal to be sufficiently achieved. Out of dozens of online courses I have taken on Coursera, this course felt like the most insightful and in-depth introduction to a topic I have ever taken.
The Computational Neuroscience course largely works to transition students from traditional thinking to thinking about extraordinarily abstract concepts. None of the problems or work in the course is truly 'difficult' beyond two or three challenging questions on the exams. Getting yourself to a point where you can think about these problems how you need to is the true 'difficulty' of this course. A student could, if they so choose, gloss over a large amount of the more difficult material to understand and still complete the course (i.e., one does not NEED to understand the derivations or proofs for, well, any of the equations given throughout the course) but would almost certainly struggle to complete a couple problems throughout the exams. With my insignificant prior exposure to some of these topics (and being absolutely incompetent with differential equations by my own admission) I would spend upwards of 8 to 12 hours per weekly quiz to truly understand the material, averaging about 15-18 hours a week to dive into the course material. 
For students with little to no prior introduction to mathematics who are interested in taking this course: There are supplementary videos provided which serve as wonderful introductions to the concepts used for each week. While presented impressively well as far as a sudden introduction to upper-level concepts can be, they may fall short for individuals looking for a deep insight into some of the subjects throughout the course. As a bonus, I personally found the presenter for these supplemental videos to be absolutely hilarious.
Important to mention - Moreso than any other course I have ever seen on Coursera, the forums for Computational Neuroscience are active and filled with incredibly intelligent, kind, and helpful neuroscientists from around the world. The depth of discussion is absolutely incredible. The wonderful users on the forum served to provide nearly as much perspective and knowledge as the course itself did. I cannot emphasize in text how truly exciting it was to engage with such informative and interested peers and experts alike. Likewise, it's quite a pleasant and incredible experience to have the lecturers present an important concept in Neuroscience, with their own names on the citation/reference for that material.
For anyone looking to gain an insight into Computational Neuroscience and all the incredible technology that has arisen from the field: Would I recommend this course? If you're looking for something fairly rigorous and don't mind the potential for a bit of 'beating-your-head-against-a-wall' style thinking, absolutely! If you have absolutely no prior experience with programming or probability and would rather a less 'intense' insight into the field, this may not be for you.",5
4545,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Zeqian L,"Nov 17, 2017","This course felt really sketchy. Lectures were going way too fast and kept skipping concepts and derivations. Not bad if one only wants a superficial grasp of these concepts, but definitely not worth the price. ",2
4546,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,T Q,"Nov 11, 2019","The first instructor is like Siri reading textbooks. Neither of the two instructors explained the concepts and calculations clearly. Just as another review says, they directly jump from too simple to too complicated. Overall this is one of the worst courses I have ever had. ",2
4547,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,王桢,"Feb 8, 2018","This course is a good start for learning computational neuroscience. I have learned how a single neuron processing signal and how to modeling this interesting process through mathematical and computational methods. I also learned the idea and models of the adaption of synapsis and coding of a group of neurons, which form the basis of memory and learning. The course also gave a brief intro to reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning and supervised learning and I can't wait to explore the fascinating world of deep learning. 
However, I think the course focusing a lot on the modeling of a single neuron rather than the modeling of a group of neurons. I think expanding the content and depth on neuron network would help the students have a better understanding on the memory or learning process. Also, the lectures in this course are very wide, whereas the quizes, although really help on understanding the lectures, are just related to some parts of the lectures. I think it would be better if the lectures closer relate to the quizes or give us a hint on where to look in the textbook in order to have a better understanding of the lectures.
Really appreciate all your efforts! learning how our brain works and the origin of our consciousness which I think is the ultimate topics of human being has always been my dream. I'm glad that this course enabled me to move closer to my dream ",4
4548,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Jiazhi G,"Aug 20, 2017","Nice content. Opens the gate of CNS for me.

4549,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Vargas H D,"Feb 6, 2017","I very much enjoyed the course overall. Lectures from week 2 to week 5 were a little bit tedious in my opinion, not because of the content, but due to the way the lecture was presented. I suggest that by the end of the course, one could see the correct answers (with explanation) of the quizzes, since that would help learning. I enjoyed the course and I learned a lot. I thank the coursera staff and the UW faculty who made this possible.",4

It really helps to learn and think about these things because it makes you realize how nothing is set in stone and the popularity of one model (MLPs) has a lot to do with history and not just mathematics.

4553,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Ivy T,"Oct 26, 2017","  I'm a professor in psychiatry with a background in clinical psychology. I conduct clinical research to understand the neural mechanisms involved in psychiatric diseases. I found the course very informative and covers topics in computational neuroscience that are critical to further my research in the computational direction. 
The course involves a moderate amount of math, which is absolutely necessary to understand the materials. For someone like me who did calculus more than 20 years ago (i.e., rusty), I often found the explanation of the math too fast. I had to pause the videos multiple times to digest the formulas and re-watch some videos to get a true understanding of the materials in order to complete the quizzes successfully (especially in later weeks as the concepts get more advanced). The supplementary tutorials by Rich Pang are extremely helpful. He talks at a slower pace, allowing time for you to think along the way. He is also very good at helping you to get an intuitive understanding of the complex concepts. I would recommend watching Rich's tutorials before watching the lecture videos. That way, you would understand the lectures more readily. 
The quizzes are overall well designed and helpful in terms of facilitating the consolidation of your understanding of the concepts and methods covered in that particular week. I don't know if it's just me. I tended to spend a lot more time than the estimated time (e.g., 3 hours instead of 1 hour) to complete and pass a quiz (especially later ones that involve more Matlab programming). 
Overall, I found this course very useful and overall well constructed.

4554,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Julia G,"Oct 1, 2017","The professors who teach the course are very engaging and are able to make a challenging topic into something interesting and entertaining. The course is very math and programming-heavy, so make sure to brush up on these concepts and be prepared to know how to conceptualize neuronal behavior with mathematical equations and programming functions and vice versa. If you have any questions to post on the Discussion Forum, be prepared to look for the answer outside of the course - the response times of the mentors or other students are horrendous and there are even some instances where questions are never answered. This, as a biology person who had little to no experience in programming or advanced calculus, was the most frustrating aspect of the course. In regards to computational neuroscience as a course, the material itself is beginner-level, but the math/programming is definitely not (more like intermediate/advanced).",3

I typically took about an hour per 20min of lecture and paused in the middle to really take in the maths, and that helped a lot. The non-academic highlight of the course was definitely Prof. Rao sense of humor.

Each week of this course could be a whole different course that really delves into the subject and not just presenting it. Video lessons were spamming you super compressed information. Some videos were sloppy and not helpful at all. 
In addition, there are no helpful videos with examples-exercises that could really reinforce your learning. From the instructors I could only understand Rajesh Rao. Supplementary Video Tutorials by Rich Pang were awesomely simplistic and understandable but not enough for this course... All we need is more detailed and well explained examples...
In sort, after successfuly completing the course, I can say that I havent really learned anything. Just a glimpse of what neuroscience is all about... I ve seen better courses. I believe this course should be renamed to ""An Introduction to Computational Neuroscience""  ",3

The homework problems were doable with assisted scripts, doing them from scratch was really tough. One can go through the solved exercises from Abbott book and other YouTube videos to get a grip on fundamentals of linear algebra and maths derivations. The TA did a great job to revise and review basics. Many topics like reinforcement learning were just touched upon, but didn't show up in its fury in quizzes!

Because of this it was easiest for me to understand when I watched all the videos each week and then went backward to get it.
I highly recommend ""start with why"" videos and book by Simon Sinek, it might give you some info on how to make the lectures more comprehensive.

4564,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Franz L,"Jan 17, 2021","I think the course has many improvement opportunities:
-Some lectures just jump from too simple to too complicated skipping important concepts. They could take more time to explain topics some of us are not experts at (as circuits analysis).
-There are no mentors who answer questions in the forums, and there are some very common doubts. Apparently, there are even some mistakes in the tests, where non of the answers is correct.
-There are no explanations about the correct answers in the tests. There are many questions I still don’t understand why the correct answer is X or Y.
-Some questions in the tests have much higher level than the one of the lectures.
-For my taste, Prof. Fairhall goes too fast in lectures. She could separate them into shorter videos, where she widely explains more focused topics.

4566,Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington,Marta M,"Mar 11, 2017","It was by far the best course I've taken on Coursera. For someone not dealing with math in their everyday life it could have been a bit challenging, but I really enjoyed watching how math, physics and neuroscience use the same concepts and how various models can be interchangeable.
Main subject was super-interesting, but I also enjoyed how it showcased how mathematical concepts can be used and applied. It's really disappointing that such approach is not that common in formal education many of us have received... For such interesting topics you presented I would go back to university and learned differential equations once again, seeing some purpose in them at last. I always knew that mathematics is a beautiful language, but during my education no-one showed me such profound and exciting problems to express them in it.
The instructors were great and guest lectures were fun as well. I am almost regretting choice of my everyday computer science career when hearing about problems you get to solve :) Thanks a lot! This was definitely one of the best online courses I've seen and time spent on it was not wasted.",5

realm of Computation Neuroscience. The lecturers presented the concepts clearly

Linear Algebra, and either Python
or Matlab before taking this course.
I had not taken very much Calculus
or Differential Equations prior to taking this course, and I had to do a
fair amount of external research to understand some aspects of the
lectures.
The professors who teach this course do a great job of
explaining the concepts and ideas of the topic, rather than just reading lots
of formulas. They break the math down to help the viewer intuitively understand
what each one is doing. Someone taking this course who doesn’t not have that
solid of a math background will have some trouble, but the course won’t be
impossible. A bit of Programming experience with either Python (2 or 3) or
Matlab, however is a must. ",5

I recommend for those who are starting the course now to go through the supplementary material before starting the lectures. 
The course opened my mind a lot about the computational neuroscience field. I can say without a doubt that this course grew a love for the field inside me, which I will keep studying from the referred books and materials.

4794,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Keragan C,"Mar 27, 2021","Overall, I thought it was a great introduction to the topics that will be covered in the certificate. A couple of areas for growth in my opinion:
1 - For the quizzes when you get an answer wrong, ideally, you are provided the right answer so you can learn from your mistake, but alternatively, it would be nice if the subsequent text included a link to the section with the information because I felt some of the answers were difficult to go back and find.  
2 - I don't like that the glossary builds on itself as you go through the course because then you end up with multiple incomplete glossary documents. It would be better to just include one full glossary to be downloaded, perhaps with highlighted colors corresponding to their respective sections in the course.
Thanks!",3

4796,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Sandy L,"Mar 22, 2021","This course felt very basic. It could have been condensed into 2-3 weeks. The beginning concepts of data life cycle, data analysis skills, and all the material covered in weeks 1-3 could have been condensed to 1 week and weeks 4-5 material could have been condensed into another week. I don't feel like I've learned anything concrete in this course because weeks 1-3 brushes on how to think as a data analyst, and weeks 4-5 only slightly brushes on spreadsheets and SQL. In addition, I looked over the discussion forums, I don't think participation in them are helpful. It says participation is optional, but it marks me off and says that I haven't completed the entire course. The good thing is that I can watch videos in a higher speed and can fast forward to the the next weeks if I move ahead. However, I worry that the course might be dragged on and some students can lose interest. I enjoyed the stories that the different instructors shared, and can feel that they are personable people. I appreciate the work put into this! ",2

However, I was hoping to learn more from most activities. The journals and self-reflection sometimes don't give much value, although I suppose they get you thinking like an analyst a bit. When giving an introduction to spreadsheets and databases, it would be significantly more helpful if the activities were more hands on. I thought that would be the case when they introduced Qwiklabs, but no. Also, I noticed a time or two, I wasn't sure how I was supposed to input an answer, i.e. I'm sure I knew the answer, but just didn't get credit for it because of how Coursera wanted me to write it.",3

Perhaps more questions could be provided during the videos to make sure people understand/pay attention to them. As in other Google courses, the discussions seem like a waste of time as many people skip them and there doesn't seem to be any punishment for not participating in them. Finally, it is just in the honor code that somebody writes in the journal. From a pedagogical perspective, it seems like a wasted opportunity.",5

When I saw the course I was expecting it to teach me how to think when approaching a data analysis task, it fails to do that. 
There are limited case studies spanned over 5 weeks! 
I would suggest it will be better, more useful to have the theoretical part restricted to one week and use the other four to dig deep into cases studies, say one case study each week and really take us with you through  the journey of that life cycle with proper examples.

But I've been working as a data analyst for a little over four years at a large company. A lot of the material in this course seemed kind of useless and tedious to me, which makes me feel bad for true beginners who are maybe a little nervous or easily overwhelmed by data concepts. I really don't see how it's useful to quiz people about pedantic jargon that they may never end up using in their career. Furthermore, some of the jargon defined in the course directly conflicts with what how I was previously educated, and what I've experienced in the workplace. For example -- I've never heard anyone call a row from a spreadsheet an ""observation."" Most people colloquially refer to it as row ""X,"" and most formally, I've heard it refered to as a record. So is it really useful to waste people's time with this information? Lastly, the quizzes were TERRIBLY written. Like I said, I'm not new to data analysis. I'm also a former journalist who minored in mathematics in undergrad and went on to earn a master's degree in supply chain mgmt. So I'm very comfortable with numbers and with reading comprehension. Yet, I found many of the questions to be frustratingly ambiguous -- very open to interpretation. Every time I got a question wrong, I fully understood the topic the question was attempting to quiz me on, but simply misunderstood the question's intent. Likewise, many of the questions felt pedantic and useless, i.e. they were quizzing the student's ability to memorize random trivia from the course material, not testing their real understanding of concepts that they are likely to use in their careers. Very frustrating experience overall. I hope the rest of the courses are better. ",1

For example: when you asked if ommiting certain data will lead to fair analysis. Your answer was not to check this column which is not correct.

6. Course Duration: The course was well-paced, and the duration was appropriate for covering the foundational concepts of data. However, in some instances, certain topics could have been expanded upon to provide a more in-depth understanding.
7. Community and Discussion Forums: The course could benefit from a more active and engaged community and discussion forums. Encouraging learners to interact and share their insights or challenges could enhance the collaborative learning experience and provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning.
8. Practical Examples: While the course included practical examples, incorporating more diverse and industry-specific use cases would further enhance the course's relevance and applicability to different domains and professional settings.
9. Certification: Offering a certification option upon course completion would be beneficial for learners who want to showcase their newly acquired skills and knowledge to potential employers or clients.
Overall, ""Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere"" is a highly informative and practical course for beginners seeking to develop a solid foundation in data-related concepts.

The systematization of the analytics process was exceptionally helpful - probably the best takeaway of the entire certificate program.  This course is a great intro to data analytics skill. It introduces tools such as spreadsheets and SQL.  Found out why I'm always analytical about things in my personal life and the critical thinking that this provides.  
I enjoyed the stories that the different instructors shared, and can feel that they are personable people. I appreciate the work put into this!It would be nice if the subsequent text included a link to the section with the information because I felt some of the answers were difficult to go back and find.

4890,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Robert P,"Apr 1, 2021","Good basic overview and introduction.
Some inconsistencies in volume level and lack of continuity between video sessions made the course difficult to listen to at times.
Because it's so basic, if you have any experience at all you will find many of the exercises--especially the writing exercises--very tedious and not particularly helpful.
The course's framing of holistic/accurate/open-minded analysis as ""fairness"" is confusing and could easily prove problematic in the formation of new analysts.",4

4900,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Kamila P,"Mar 26, 2023","Too much theory on a very basic level stretched over too many weeks. 
The course is created for total beginners who don't even understand the concept of data. Does it really make sense to make it so basic, considering the fact that in the same specialization we should learn about SQL or R and that this specialization should prepare us for entry level data analyst jobs? They allow you to skip the lessons if you pass the initial test and only complete the “challenges”, but even if you have some previous data analysis experience you may be surprised by the number of challenges questions asking for specific definitions of terms (which must match the glossary presented in the course).
I'm totally surprised that the creators thought that the format of repeating the same definitions (in a school manner) and giving obvious, little real work-related examples over and over again will teach anybody what a professional data analyst does in their work. ""Talking head"" + text to read + filling learning logs (which takes a lot more time than the first two elements even if it adds comparably little value ) is not an effective way of presenting this kind of content. There should be a lot more gamification and visualization to make it interesting and easier to remember.
Instead of talking and talking about how important a data analyst job is, I'd expect to be allowed to learn the concepts by following real job-related scenarios along with the information what kind of data analysis tool would be used and why (even if without any further details at this moment). What was really surprising about that course was a final challenge where… we eventually need to follow the real scenarios and we even were asked some more technical questions, rather easy, but not covered in the course material.
Hard to say who could really be the target audience for this theoretical course… But definitely not people who think seriously of starting a junior data analyst job - they would need to search for more advanced and more applicable theory somewhere else.",2
4901,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Farrukh K,"Aug 16, 2023","Let's address the elephant in the room: content delivery. It's baffling to me how a course that claimed to be a learning opportunity turned out to be a prolonged monologue. Approximately 90% of the course consisted of endless talk, droning on with theoretical discussions that seemed to have no end in sight. It was nothing short of torture to sit through these never-ending lectures.  
What's more infuriating is the complete lack of hands-on learning and skill-building exercises. It's as if you forgot that your students signed up actually to learn practical skills and apply them in real-world scenarios. Instead, we were subjected to an unrelenting barrage of information without any opportunity to put that information into action. The handful of exercises that were thrown our way were woefully inadequate, and they only served to highlight the glaring void in the practical aspect of the course.  
To sum it up, the course was a colossal waste of my time and money. I expected to come out of this with tangible skills and a sense of accomplishment, but all I got was a masterclass in endurance and frustration. I sincerely hope that you take this feedback to heart and seriously reconsider your approach to teaching. Students deserve better than this one-sided, uninspiring lecture-fest that masquerades as education.
I have no intention of recommending this course to anyone, and I genuinely regret the decision to enroll in it.

4902,"Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere by Google",Landon C,"Nov 18, 2022","The course was okay in general but a lot of it felt like a waste of time. Here are the pros and cons.
PROS:
It was good for introducing the topics you will be looking at more in depth, was positive, and all of the content was very high quality and accessible.
CONS:
The main issues I had with it was that it repeated the same things over and over so many times that it actually got fairly irritating because it was often not even useful. They could have made all the same points in about half the amount of time or less. SO much of it was telling you ""what you are going to learn"" and giving you pats on the back at every turn. Instead of telling students what they are going to learn over and over, just teach it because that's what we all are here for. An occasional ""good job"" at at the end of a quiz is nice, but you really don't need to tell me how much of a ""rockstar"" I am and how ""exciting this journey is"" at the beginning of every video. It feels pretty shallow and patronizing after the first 3-5 times you hear it in just the first few videos.",2

The teaching approach on this course is similar teaching a kid that wants to grow-up to be a baseball player, the he or she first need to know statistics and physics that is involved in the game of baseball. say, first learn at what angle the bat has to be in order to generate the height and speed necessarity to get the ball out of the park and what is the probability of it considering wind, rain, and other elements. THAT KID WILL NEVER GET SWING A BAT if this is the route he/she is on. So this bottom-up approach is BORING and IRRELEVANT. I don't think i need to know that ask comes before blah, and that share comes before blah. Get me hands-on activities that will encourage the student to ask what is the problem about, how to collect the data, what process should be follow, etc, etc.

Putting this into Specialization requirements is smart from your perspective, you are basically saying if you want to reach Capstone pay me $50 more, but at least fix the typos you made during video, just a little respect to your subscribers. But right now, I highly doubt that Capstone Project will be something serious that I want to mention in my Linkedn. There is also downside of what you do. But since you are in between the top rated courses either nobody uses Coursera anymore or people are silent enough and patient enough.
You are all Scientists like me, I'm also biostatistician but I would never ever post a course like this to any platform. I'd rather use Google or Facebook ads to lead people here.
If somebody wise enough to get Data Science Course, he should be skillful enough to download R, click next and install it, and R has help for it, shows you step by step. GitHub is free platform, anyone who can signup for Coursera can signup for GitHub, too.
I know there is no requirements for this course or specialization course, it is 0 to Scientist but seriously you are talking about R codes, arrays, loops, regression, model fit but signing up for GitHub.
Your target group in Coursera is either Data Scientist or becoming one, so they know what the Data Scientist job posts requires. 
It requires coding blind folded R/Python/Java/one of C family at least 2 of them, hopefully all of them. 
It requires SQL, MySQL, NoSQL, any kind of SQL or database solution mankind ever used.
It requires Math, Statistics, Analytics, Algebra, Finance, Economics + all kinds of computational sciences
It requires management, social relations, advertising, psychology, anthropology + rest of the social sciences.
+++++ it requires LOGIC and NON-ARTIFICIAL HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
so we are trying to be that guy, no need to show installing R or GitHub, I'm sure you will do it again doing rest of the Specialization.",1

4919,The Data Scientist’s Toolbox by Johns Hopkins University,Debajyoti N,"Aug 13, 2016","This should not be a course. It's just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers. This is not a learning course.  All they teach you how to install git, R and Rstudio.  And they take money for this (if you want to say you ""completed"" the course)!!! Highly unethical practice in my opinion. 
The surveys are stupid too.  They don't distinguish between those who completed (but not earned any credentials) and those who didn't. 
In my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course (and not a cours in itself).  Definitely not worth 4 weeks!

I read 1 star reviews' and found people saying lots of things, for example:
1) ""Having a course that teaches you how to install programs is very basic and lazy""
The Data Science field sounds challenging to me. Even though I know how to install programs, this easy approach makes the course seems achievable for me. I'm thankful for this, because I guarantee this course will suit people with different academic backgrounds and since it's not really complicated or difficult, it is in fact a very welcoming introduction for a field that might scare people. 
Even though I thought this course was going to dig deeper into Data Science topics, the title of the course states it clearly: Data Scientist's Tool Box. 
2) ""The robotic voice is so boring and distracting I couldn't finish the course""
It wasn't for me. In fact, it was better. I found it less distracting than watching a human being talking. 
Also, I think the way they explained why they make the course videos this way is genius. It makes you want to learn Data Science, which I think is one of the most important things a teacher should do: get you excited about the subject. 
This course is intended to be completed in 4 week, I finished it in a week.

Instructors basically just read words in slides, no interesting examples and no hands-on practices, especially week 4 slides that look like a syntax reference document. So the entire instruction is very boring, making me wonder why I need to sit here and listen to word reading rather than buying a textbook. Also, people coming here to learn it are new learners. When the instruction skipped much and made the content not logical and complete, it is very difficult for us to understand what the video is talking about. That's why in forum there are so many people expressing their confusions.  This entire specialization is the one that I've taken and feel the worst (I got lost in the R course too). I strongly recommend the instructors of this course watch and learn how the instructor of the specialization ""Python for Everyone"" organizes and teaches the content.

I have used RStudio with github and was taking this course to refresh all of the steps needed as I may need to help others with the process, and I found it frustrating. The quizzes could be removed because they only check if you read the material, and sometimes the questions repeat between the shorter quizzes and longer quiz within the same module. On that note, a version of this course with only the text and graphics portions would be appreciated. I found the automated voiceover videos unwatchable, and it takes time to navigate past them.

1) We don't have access to the slides anymore. This is a major issues since some of the slides content important links. These links are not shown in the transcript (I've double checked).
2) When we try to download the videos, subtitles or transcript, the resulting file name is the same for all content of the same type. More specifically, all videos are named ""index.mp4"", all subtitle files are named ""subtitles.vtt"" and all transcript files are named ""subtitle.txt"". This makes it more difficult for the student to save the files. In the previous version I would only right-click and saved in the right directory. Now, I have to right click, type the right name (which could be long sometimes) and then save the file.
3) In the previous interface, it was possible to see all the threads we were subscribed to. It is no more the case. It is not a problem right now, because there is not a lot of posts, but in cases where the number of post increase, it will be a pain to go through the list of threads and find the ones of interest.

5017,The Data Scientist’s Toolbox by Johns Hopkins University,Ishe C,"Apr 5, 2020","This is a recommended course for anyone serious with data science. It is highly accessible, especially for screen-reader users who may be comfortable taking lectures using text rather than videos. I was able to successfully complete assignments on my own without problems. However, the only setback I see with the course is its over-reliance on RStudio. While Rstudio is a great IDE for R programming, it is not yet fully accessible. So questions like, ""Which quadrant is at the bottom right corner"" are answered as a guess-work rather than full knowledge. I suggest that command-line options be considered as this is accessible for everyone. Thus, while the GUI option is left intact, there is need to also provide command-line alternative to accomplishing the same thing. Otherwise, this course is perhaps the best when it comes to introducing the concepts on data science. ",5

Most of the instructions are clear and easy to follow, but I found myself constantly trapped in the section ""Linking an existing Project with Git"", especially how to find the right directory in Git Bash in the process of linking.

I'm a mechanical engineer, so this is a different way of thinking for me.

I think an introduction or more reference to necessary statistical/mathematical knowledge would be good, but I understand if that's outside the purview of the course. 
I also love the amount of extra, supplemental material you can review, whether it's a linked article or Leanpub book written by the lecturers. Would definitely recommend this course to other people interested in data.",5

However, the focus of the feedback should be based essentially on what the students is doing right.  It is most productive to a student’s learning when they are provided with an explanation and example as to what is accurate and inaccurate about their work.

Peer review can be challenging as I notice on my work that the answers were correct but the other peers are saying is wrong. What I notice is this https://www.datascience.com will be considered correct but if the text is  datascience with a hyperlink, it is considred wrong. It will be good if this will be reviewed.",5
5039,The Data Scientist’s Toolbox by Johns Hopkins University,Martins P,"Aug 6, 2021","Very helpful and well organised, easy to follow and I believe it sets you up very well for the following courses. 
If you are looking to learn R and have some previous statistical analysis background (I have learned Minitab 19 for about 3 years now) but have no coding knowledge, I would reccomend not skipping this course as it will help you set up R and introduce you to its basic functions, otherwise it could seem a bit overwhelming.

A completely new framework is covered in a 3min video in week 1, prompting me to spend 2.5h googling what that is, only to find an introductory video to it in week 3! And this happened several times. It assumes I am familiar with cloud platforms (why? who is the course for? I'm a data scientist, and I'm obviously not the target audience) and provides no free option for me to practice. There are no graded assignments and the quizzes are too easy, I passed the ones in week 4 and 5 before watching a single video, a possible strategy is just to pick the answer with the largest number of words. Overall, I feel the author did not bother at all to watch and read his own course after making it by throwing in a bunch of pre-existing unrelated materials, leaving the course completely lacking flow and structure.

I really wanted the second course to be better but unfortunately it was not. This course feels like it was put together in a rush and never reviewed. The videos aren’t logically connected leading to some bigger lesson … it’s just a bunch of random videos Noah reused from his YouTube channel. I think putting a 2 plus hour video completely disregards Coursera’s style of structuring a course. Often times videos aren’t ordered in the slightest way – we get a massive 2 hour video on a tool and then, AFTER, a short 4 minute video introducing the tool and topic. There is no focus towards a set of tools used in the course, it’s more of a generic “you can use this”, “you can also use that”, “this also exists”. The course feels like one big chaotic introduction to a lot of different things that are out there on the market. The quizzes were a joke … I barely made it to the middle of week 3 and then just completed the remaining 3 quizzes without even looking at the videos.

So after hours of frustration you have to read the forums and then figure out how to solve it. There is no way to see the issue in a dataset with 600k records. The tasks don't seem difficult after doing them.

5083,Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University,Jacquelynn,"Sep 25, 2020","Overall, I learned alot about how to use Tableau in this class.  I had never used it before starting.  A few items about the course though that need fixing/updating.  First, the version of Tableau that I was using differed at times from what the instructor was doing on her screen.  Specifically, when doing calculations in week 3, the version she was using was much more user friendly than what my version offered.  For someone new to using this tool it was a challenge to figure out how to work around that issue.  Also, many of the additional reading links provided were outdated and did not work.  I was also unpleasantly surprised that I would post a question and not receive an answer.  It seems that someone associated with this class should be available to answer questions (and instead of saying, that was answered in a previous post--there are literally pages upon pages--just help the students so they can move along).  Lastly, for the final project the suggested recording software ""Jing"" is no longer available as of 2020 so the instructor might want to find a new acceptable recording tool to use, then update the presentation and update the instructions in the assignment.  One note about course grading.......In the previous course in this specialization, when it came time to peer review assignments, assignments automatically popped into a queue for review however in this course, peer grading felt like a free for all where you had to grade someones work and try to get them to grade yours.  Ultimately, I got mine graded but it seems this process shouldn't be a free for all because then there is no accountability for who gets graded.  ",3

5162,Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University,Bertrand J d,"Mar 11, 2016","This course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists: it may give the false impression that, with the tools learned here, you will be able to analyze your data by yourself. In fact, you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and, as a result, you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job. For example, what is the point of giving you a single 10-minutes video on how to do regression in Tableau if you don't even know regression (which is AT LEAST a one-term course in graduate school, and only after several other prior basic stats courses)? BEWARE: get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life. Some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a pre-requisite for this course, or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance. The problem is: some of your audience will know and will notice, more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiot. 
Sorry to be negative here, but I think I owe you, my co-student, at least a warning: do learn more stats elsewhere!! ... good luck. ",2
5163,Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University,Elina V,"Sep 12, 2020","The professor makes a good effort to explain the course material in a logical and engaging manner. 
The weekly assignments, however, are poorly worded and have mistakes (like a wrong file name which entails learners continuously asking on the forum about where to find it). Despite the fact that these assignments are ""not graded"", the actual quizzes are based directly on them, so they are critical. It's a course on Tableau and the assignments don't have a single screenshot which would have been so much more helpful than 2 paragraphs of text explaining which menu you have to click on.
Moreover, I counted 39 moderators/teaching staff listed on the Discussions Forum, however there was NO SINGLE ANSWER from the teaching staff posted there for over a month. In other words, don't count on any support. Peers do try to help each other, but it's not enough.

Design of the course was excellent. They prepared the syllabus based on the Industry standards.Right from week 1, they taught how to approach data as a data analyst,and slowly introduced the basics of tableau in week 2. They taught all important features like creating calculation field,building dashboards and story in week 3. Couldn't able to understand all those concepts in single week. In week 4, it was full of videos describing about how to give presentation as a data analyst before stakeholders,one of the necessary skills for data analyst.In week 5, they asked us to build a final project for dognition and it was cool.

5171,Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University,Olga K,"Feb 1, 2016","Really great course! Very well organized, material is engaging and really well presented. 
Covers everything you need to know to get started with Tableau (hands on!). If you already work with Tableau, will be quite easy for you to complete the course, but you may still learn a few cool tricks from Jana.
I also really liked the first week of the course where Jana went over the general concepts of being a good data analyst. They aren't shocking or extremely eye opening, but nonetheless it is very important to truly understand. I found it interesting the way she presented them.
Great job with the course! Most engaging course I personally tried on Coursera so far :)",5

Some things I may suggest thouhg, is if it is possible add some notes for using Tableau public, because some funcions are either different or not ""exactly"" available.

Module quizzes are tough too, don't expect to just rewatch the video to complete the tests as you have to work through it. If you are only looking for Tableau tutorials this course isn't for you, but if you want to hone your analytical and communication skills I can say this one is definitely worth trying.",5

5195,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,MD. S I,"Aug 10, 2020",This course has made me fall in love with probability. Highly recommended for anyone who dislikes probability. You will end up loving probability later. Great instructor and quality lecture material.,5
5196,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,Rick N,"Jun 19, 2020","This course contained useful information, but I disliked the corny, jokey style in which it was presented.  
The quiz questions and answer choices were confusing and frustrating.  I especially disliked the obscure cultural references, such as television shows or internet memes.  There were also numerous typographical errors and grammar errors.
A good point was that numerous real-world examples were presented.  A bad point was that several annoying, silly, and unrealistic toy examples were presented.
The content was useful, but  I wonder how useful it would be to someone who has no prior statistical or report-reading experience.  For example, some students may have never seen a p-value before, and the explanation provided may have been insufficient for them.
I also strongly object to the use of the term ""hard variable"" to describe a variable that is clinically important.
""Hard variables"" are those that are quantified and objectively measured.  ""Hard data"" are data that take on quantitative values, and this is not restricted to births and deaths.  
""Quality of life"" is often subjective, not objective, so I do not consider it to be a ""hard variable"", even though it is clinically important.
I am glad I took the course because the content of the course is important.
 However,  I did not enjoy taking the course.  It left me with an unpleasant, frustrated feeling of belittlement.  The professor seemed to speak to the students as if they were young children.  I was puzzled at why the professor apparently did not take the material seriously.",4

So if you want an intermediate level, then this class may not be suitable. But, if you are a person who learnt probability years ago and kind of forget the thinking ways of probability, this class can help you pick yourself up quickly and help you recall the knowledge of probability. If you are totally new to probability, this class is also suitable because the professor used many cases to help you understand the interesting side of probability ( : ( PS:  if you need to do probability exercise like me, you may find probability is not as interesting as before >-<)",5

I highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to learn about the fundamentals of probability, even those who don't use the subject in their career or lives.
My only bit of criticism would be that the course relies on intermittent checks for understanding as the sole criterion for passing the course rather than longer, broader problem sets. I would love to see more in the way of rigorous exams and projects. But I suppose that's what more advanced courses are for! If this course is intended to be a gentle introduction to the broad subject with the understanding that students will follow up with more advanced coursework as necessary, they have certainly succeeded admirably at that goal.",5

The lectures of Karl were outstanding, very clear, direct to the point,  with concrete examples to erase any doubts. The exercises with José  helped me reinforce the concepts learned with Karl, not to mention the  real world applications (the most enjoyable part for me), which also were very interesting and were the main reason the course got me hooked. 
To be honest, I had already taken a probability course many years ago but this was definitely  better. Now I realize I hadn´t fully understood key concepts until now  and I´m sure that in the future I won´t forget them easily. 
If anything I would suggest adding another application to the Bayes´ Theorem: Bayesian Networks for Artificial Intelligence.

I can't recommend this enough. The key to all of it is allowing yourself to listen to Professor Schmedders and absorb what he's saying on the intuitive level. I am so glad I did. This is absolutely fascinating now, and went back to my old books wondering why this was so difficult. I can say in hindsight, it was the focus of not really understanding the meaning and the constraints of the applications. Where I made those fundamental errors such as ""the flaw of averages"", ""the prosecutors fallacy"", and the variance in the normal distribution being comparable. Thanks you, thank you, thank you. Looking for more courses and opportunities in probability, which are limitless or should I say have a cumulative probability of being applicable =1.

Adequate explanations were not provided when learning new concepts, and I had to look up multiple concepts and watch separate videos to understand them. I finished the course now, and it has left me more confused than before...?
Also, after Week 4, it was all about executing commands in Excel. As someone who doesn't use Excel all that often and was looking for explanations that could be used in olympiad examinations (the name says that it is an ""Introduction"", which is why I thought it would build a foundation that I could use), I was disappointed. 
The in-class questions and Exercise quiz questions were oddly specific to the prompts in class. For example, in the Exercise questions, the answers to whatever would be asked on the quiz would be answered. You merely had to copy them.
Naturally, it would be expected of me to rate this course lower than 3 stars, but I do like how a lot of real life examples were used and many different formulas and diagrams were displayed.",3

5210,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,Edwin C v E,"Jul 30, 2023","As the title suggests, it really is an intuitive introduction to probability. In many math and statistics courses, the “theorem, proof” approach is taken. Not so in this course! The number of formal definitions is kept to a minimum and hardly any proofs are given (except the total obvious ones). Instead, the prof takes a more intuitive approach on how to calculate probabilities of primarily discrete (and some continuous) variables.
The many practical, real world examples given in the field of e.g. finance, construction, insurance  and games make an illuminating connection with the world around us. The handful of Excel documents that are supplied help to play around with the concepts and built-in probability functions in Excel. If a specialization would be created by this professor, then I would certainly enroll. Too bad there is no final exam, which would be my only remark.",5
5211,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,Naveen G,"Apr 7, 2020","I always used to run away from the probabilistic world, until I enrolled in this course. Prof. Schmedders delivered on his promises by not just giving a great foundation on probability, but also by making it fun (with a good sense of humor) and exciting (with real world applications as examples). And yes, I no more hate probability. I'd like to convey my heartfelt gratitude to Prof. Schmedders for this wonderful course. The exercise sessions were also fun. The supplementary reading material was also very interesting, and it serves as a lifetime notes. May be, a final quiz covering all the modules would be worth having in order to test ourselves. 
I request Prof. Schmedders to create more courses on advanced probability as I believe he would be able to make a difference in teaching probability.",5
5212,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,Victoria L,"Jun 1, 2018","Excellent course to introduce or review concepts of statistics and probability. I found the calculations of probabilities much easier to do than before starting the course and following the Excel functions. I also loved the energy and charisma of both Professor Karl and assistant Jose as well as the types of exercises (e.g. Biles Olympic performances or the probabilities to survive being hit by an asteroid). Please, please, please, do another on-line course like this one for next level statistics. I would love to learn more about Bayesian applications, for example, and through your teachings. In short, I highly recommend this course for a refresher of statistics and for learning statistics in a fun an applicable way. Cheers! ",5

Go for it if you are willing to gain some basic and also influential knowledge about probability.  By the time I was taking this course I was a reading a book named 'The Black Swan' by Nassim Nicholas Taleb . And I tell you there were many similarities between the sayings of this professor and the author of the book. Well that might be the another reason I enjoyed this course well.

Even when I may have preferred a little bit of additional theory and samples in Python (I come from CS ;-), I understand that the current format of the course reaches a much wider audience. This is one of those rare cases when abstract theory is smashed to the ground of applications, in a quite amusing way.

Professor Karl has really removed my fear and I want to invest more time now in learning more aspects about this. More importantly I could understand all the examples he has explained. Now I know the concepts Conditional probability, random variable and normal distribution. For me, no more, random variable is not just calling a 'rand()' function, normal distribution is no more a bell curve which just looks good and I have more regards for Excel as a tool to compute probabilities. Thanks. ",5

Despite that concepts were very basic the explanation was clear and enjoyable. All the examples mentioned made this even more clear. Expaining some material with an example and not directly with a formula was something new to me and it worked very well.  The quizes during lectures is a very good idea too. They check if you really are listening to Karl. The quiz questions are competent to the material. Exercises at the end of weeks were fun to do. The TA explained every part of the problems in an understandable manner. ,5

5225,An Intuitive Introduction to Probability by University of Zurich,Riju P,"Jan 9, 2024",Overall the professor has done a great job in the initial 3 weeks. He made it so easy and interesting that the concepts of probability which are always confusing were clarified. While I did not get very same level of engagement in the last two weeks and perhaps. This is also because the expectation set during the initial was was very high. Again overall a super course and a big thank you to the professor and the whole team.

I was trying to evaluate a few Online training options to decide which is the best to recommend to my organization but this has been an absolute deal breaker.

ised by the thouroughness of this course. The different quizzes and assignments it contains are well placed, well constructed, and they provide an adequate challenge considering the stakes. Going through this course I felt I acquired a good overall view of data science as an industry, it's impact, and it's tools. I must re-affirm the strength of the quizzes and assignments in this course before that's really what made the entire experience for me. As a true beginner in the field of data science, I came out of every assignment (especially the last few) feeling like I had given my best effort and sollicitated the key 'take-away' concepts, and that's obviously a great thing. That's the point, that's what you want.  So if you're a beginner in this domain I can say unequivocally say that I think you will also feel like you've gotten your time (and money)'s worth here, if you're ready to invest it. A course that squarely delivers on it's promise. ",5

else. I really like this course because there are so many real life 
cases about how company use and benefit from data to improve their 
profit and effectiveness. There was also a simulation on how to be a 
consultant which gave me insights about what and how consultants works 
in helping their clients. At the end of the course, there was also a 
project. This project gave me an opportunity to test and apply all of knowledges and insights that i've got to real life

5679,Statistical Inference for Estimation in Data Science by University of Colorado Boulder,Derek B,"Jun 24, 2022","This class is okay. I think there are some good things about it. I'll start with those. First, the instructor does not dumb the math down, which I respect. It does feel like some of the other MOOCs soften the math to make customers happier, and this course does not do that. My brain hurt at a few points, but I'm assuming this is good pain. You will definitely feel more confident in your math abilities after completing this course. I also really appreciated having someone explain why we use things like the t-distribution or the chi-2 distribution, rather than just presenting them as magic. So that stuff is great.
My complaints are mostly connected with the non-credit version of the course. Basically, this course charges a lot, even if you are not taking it for credit. The average I've seen is $39 a month, and this charges twice that at $79. I would say that is not a big deal, except that Boulder also provides less support than your average Coursera course. And by less support I mean none. Most other courses I've taken do seem to have some moderator who will answer questions in the discussion forum. I have not seen any moderator for this course. I have not had any of my questions answered. Boulder is not interested.
This wasn't really a problem for the first course in the series, ""Probability Theory,"" because that course provided a lot of different kinds of assignments to help you master and understand the concepts. So I felt like the course was still worth the extra price. But the assignments here are almost entirely quizzes, and a lot of the material is much harder to understand. Despite passing all the quizzes in weeks 2 and 3 on the first try, I don't really feel like I have a good handle on what was going on in those modules. And the course does not recommend any additional resources--problem sets you can work on on your own, reading, etc--to help get a better understanding of what's going on. A lot of the difficult mathematics in the quizzes felt more like proving you could do mental acrobatics  than anything that would help you get the concepts.
I also think the instructor for this course and the instructor for the previous course in the series need to coordinate more. The first module of this course seems like it is supposed to be review of the topics covered in the previous one. But actually we are asked to do things that are much more complicated than the previous course covered, and we go through the material much more quickly. Either the previous course should be a bit harder, or this one needs to be toned down a bit.
So there are definitely things to like about this course. But I think Boulder needs to do more to justify the price tag.",3
5680,Statistical Inference for Estimation in Data Science by University of Colorado Boulder,Daniel G,"Feb 15, 2023","The level of the Homework Questions and Programming assignments were far to difficult compared to what was taught in class.

3. a graded assignment where you have to create a survey design
4. Jupyter notebooks with exercises for you to explore statistical concepts in Python
5. walkthrough videos on Jupyter notebook exercises if you need some help to unblock yourself or when you want to understand why certain things were done


The training was alittle lengthy but well worth the time. At times, because concepts can be explained in long sentences, you may need to rewind and revisit certain parts of the videos to get the full meaning of what has been explained.


Overall, this training refreshed my understanding of:
1. basic statistical concepts - statistical measures, population, sampling
2. using numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy packages in Jupyter notebooks (which was good because I currently dont code in Python at work)


This training also explained practical ideas such as:
1. stratifying, clustering, why these concepts are important when sampling
2. issues with certain sampling approaches
3. useful ways to turn a non-probability sample into a probability sample, so that the analysis/claims you present would be grounded in a more solid basis.

Points 2 and 3 in the list above were neither covered in school nor statistics texts in the past. So like me, you may get the chance to learn something new to apply to your work.",5

For a student who does not already understand data analysis I would not recommend this course as it doesn't explain or give any examples of what a real dataframe is used for, what do the rows and columns (or series) typically represent. It would be great to see the instructor release a v2 of this class and show examples that are more realistic both in terms of the data and the types of operations on the data.  Instead of using random numbers, you could have a tiny database of students and their progress towards learning pandas, for example.

I took a Machine Learning Class from Stanford which was incredibly well put together and presented (though to be fair, it was 12 weeks), but it was in MatLab and I wanted to take a course in Python just to have a different perspective and solidify my understanding. Unfortunately, I find this course to be confusing more than anything. If I hadn't taken the Stanford course before, I'd be completely lost. It's very dry, dense, and hand-wavy and doesn't go into a whole lot of details with anything leaving you wondering what's happening and why and how... I don't approve of jumping straight to using the built-in functions if you don't understand the processes behind them (which I personally don't have a solid grasp on them still) ... I think they are just trying to fit too much information into four weeks and it's really lacking. Maybe if you're already familiar with linear regression, it's not as hard to follow.

5907,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Taylan T,"Oct 21, 2019","TLDR; Boring and unstructured courses that do not offer insight. You learn by doing the assignments.
The video lectures are boring and unstructured. You can tell the lecturer really hates what he is doing often sulking and showing zero enthusiasm. Also, he makes you question if he really knows what he is talking about. I am sure he does but his attitude and sloppy mistakes give you doubt. The format of the video lectures is that the lecturer reads a script in front of the camera and the algorithm he talks about is shown in cutscenes. This is a terrible idea. Also, the courses are not well prepared, lacking continuity. On top of that lecturer often makes mistakes and these mistakes are ""corrected"" by showing you a cutscene that writes the professor wanted to say X instead of Y. This is really sloppy. This is not an open course where you put your recorded lectures to youtube for free. You are delivering these lectures to paying customers. Seriously many free lectures on youtube are better built compared to these lectures. I have learned a lot of things in these lectures by doing the assignments and trying to learn by using google and not via lectures.

5912,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Aziz J,"Nov 7, 2017","My biggest critique of this class is that it is not challenging at all. Homework assignments are just a repeat of the lectures and take less than an hour if you took notes on the lectures. In other words, there is no value in the homework assignments. 
The first two courses in this specialization were awesome. We did real life examples for homework assignments and through research you learned more than you had asked for. It was perfect. 
Even in lectures, there is nothing 'applied' about this course. The professor just covers the content with no real-life examples. Very mundane and unexciting.
Also, why not talk about multi-label classification? Professor takes a real example with multiple labels (handwritten digits), makes it a binary class and then proceeds to explain it... Thanks. 
My recommendation would be to restructure the homework assignments. Instead of having 7 questions that spoon-fed you the solution of a primitive problem, ask us to do some Kaggle challenges, or give us a topic that we go out and solve, do some peer-reviewed assignment. Lastly, if you don't have time or don't want to explain important concepts like pipeline, nested cross validation, and multi-label classification, add them as resources.

5917,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Navish A,"Jul 20, 2020","I just completed the third course (Applied Machine Learning course) over the last 7 days. 
Good: 
The course syllabus is quite well designed for an applied intro ML course
Assignments are nice & force you to think; you cannot simply watch the lectures & complete them straightaway; which is good in my opinion.
Needs to Improve: 
The lectures are atrociously boring. The professor seems to be reading out from a teleprompter in a flat pitch.
There are parts where the intuition behind the concepts are well explained and others where you are left staring at stars and better off learning from other sources over the net. 
The course seems to have been all but abandoned. Common mistakes in the assignment setup & lecture recordings have not been corrected since the course was first offered 2.5 years ago. The discussion forums keep getting spammed on similarly asked questions which can be easily solved by correcting the assignment errors and providing a few clearer comments/instructions. Week 3 lectures definitely need to be re-recorded as there is a correction prompt on every video. There is one 'Mentor' who helps out as a volunteer. No one else to moderate the forums.
The course pace is quite uneven and patchy. Week 2 is extremely heavy while week 1 super light. Week 3 is good but week 4 feels half done/rushed. Seems like there is an arbitrary administrative requirement to do a four week course from UMich.
 All in all, I did not come away impressed & elated from the course. I did expect much better from my Alma Mater.

5920,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Milos P,"Jun 28, 2018","Decent material and I appreciate the amount of hard work that went into building the course. However, the course should really be titled ""Evaluating Classification Methods"", as that is pretty much the focus of the entire class. The lectures (especially in Week 2) were SOOOOOO long and very hard to absorb, that even double-speed didn't help. In education, less is more. I would compare this course to the reading of a textbook. There was very little focus on making sense of the code and solving real-world problems and far too much emphasis on shotgunning (what felt like) every single classification technique known to man and trivializing pros and cons of each method. To make matters even more strange, PCA and other useful methods were pushed into ""optional"". This course should really be a two-part course, especially since the claim is that the course requires 18 hours of time. Sure, type in the code just as the professor does and you get the right answer, but meaning is lost of if you are to adhere to the timeline. If I didn't know more about machine learning and this class had been the first one I had taken, I couldn't run fast enough from the pursuit of a career in this field. Data analysis is intriguing and the methods are varied and fascinating. For me personally, this class was a let-down.

Combing through the videos turned out to be futile and of course, relying on external sources such as stackoverflow was also not very helpful since the questions asked need to be extremely specific to the course.

Additionally, while feature selection and data cleaning are large components of the final project, they are not at all the focus of what is taught in the course!

5958,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Nick S,"Jan 13, 2024","This is the 8th course I am taking with UoM. The previous experience was great, I really liked it.
Unfortunately, this time is different.

The grading system is not working. I can't pass the assignments ##2-3. I spent roughly 3 weeks doing this Applied Machine Learning course. Probably, 50% of my time was wasted on attempts to fix the Jupiter Notebook grading system (googling, reading discussion forums, trying to reach out to Coursera). Sadly, the result is negative. 

If you look at the discussion forum of weeks 2-3, you will see that a lot of students face same problems and receive very limited support, if any. Some of them decided to drop.

To clarify, I finished all previous UoM courses with 97-100%. My mark for the 1st week assignment of AML - 100%, final assignment - 100%. Average quiz mark - 90+.
2nd assignment - 0%.
3rd assignment - 0%.
System gives no feedback, no comments. Just spits out zeros.
No support from the Educator.

In typical academic fashion, it churns out a bunch of lectures, expects you to remember the content, then throws you straight into some quite complicated problems. Half the time, these problems don't even work and you have to dive into the forums to find out how to correct mistakes that the content providers have failed to correct themselves, even several years down the line. There are iPython notebooks you can use to follow along with the lectures, but really they could do with useful information and explanation embedded within them, which is one of the main strengths of iPython notebooks and has been sorely underutilised here. If the course material were presented in a more interactive and engaging manner, the learner might be more motivated and engaged when solving assignment problems. As it is, unless you have prior knowledge or experience within the field, or a mountain load of free time, it's more an education in frustration than machine learning.",2

Given this, he does a really good job. You see that he would like to show us much, much more, but he simply cannot, due to the limitations of the platform. There are many valuable, custom methods (functions) available in Python in the lab, in form of custom libraries.

5997,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Jun-Hoe L,"Jun 3, 2020","My actual rating is 3.5 stars. This is the best course yet in this Specialization. 
Pros: I prefer Professor Collin-Thompson's delivery compared to Professor Brook in the previous modules. I think he gives a good overview and sufficient depth for an applied course, compared to Professor Brooks which I find to be quite superficial most of the time, and weirdly detailed in other parts. Assignment is good enough for reinforcement learning and definitely better planned. I also appreciate the link to additional readings which are quite informative. 
Cons: Assignment auto-grader. This  is still the biggest letdown of all the courses in this specialization Codes which work on your laptop or suggested elsewhere on Stackoverflow etc fails to pass the autograder, so 30-40% of the time of the assignment is spent on wrangling the code to pass the autograder.

6008,Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan,Kevin L,"Jun 25, 2017","A great introduction to the practical side of machine learning, particularly if you have already taken Andrew Ng's course. It covers a *lot* of material and the pacing is *very* fast. Week 2 is particularly long, and if you are still a student/working it may take an extra week to complete the course. Quizzes and assignments are not terribly difficult, but be careful of the project assignment in Week 4 (though the bar for a 100% is quite low!). Finally, the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks are very helpful and there are many helpful links to outside resources as well.
A few of the lecture videos feel like an early draft rather than production-quality, with lots of time spent on repeating phrases. The instructor mentions things to be covered ""later,"" but that ""later"" never comes (for example, in discussing Grid Search). For some background, this course appears to have been repeatedly delayed before its release. To me, is understandable that the creators wanted to get this course out given the demand, but the rush is felt.
Ultimately, however, this is still an excellent introduction to Python Machine Learning, and I do feel the course is well worth taking. Just be prepared to do some more individual learning; however, shouldn't one always be for an online class?)",5

As far as I am concerned,  I worked it along with several books and this course helped me learn quick and effective hands-on machine learning  skills, to complement my theoretical knowledge.   If you are a complete beginner in ML, this is clearly not a stand-alone course and you will need, for example, to refer to either Andrew Ng's coursera course on machine learning or to Christopher Bishop's book (as I did).  Overall, I consider this course has helped me a lot  and I learned a huge amount of useful things and good practices.  I now feel confident enough  to apply for jobs in the ML field,  which is what I enrolled (and paid) for.  Nevertheless,  I would have appreciated  a  dedicated section  specifically on how to  handle categorical variables.  This matter is not really treated throughout the 4 weeks and I think it would have been a better choice to include it  instead of the very superficial optional introduction to Deep learning.

The assignments were often difficult and took many hours longer than the stated 3-4 hours. Assignment 4 was particularly heavy in time. I finished the course feeling equipped and confident enough to take on straightforward machine learning projects from start to finish. I've dropped a star because the autograder uses an older version of Python and older libraries, which meant I had to spend around 8 hours re-engineering my *correct* code to conform to old libraries.

The final assignment was especially useful as it was almost completely unguided and gave us a dataset which is unlike the tidied up, dummy datasets you'd find in online courses. So it was, by some means, an independent project. The data was messy, full of errors, and maybe downright ugly. We needed to clean the data and do quite a bit of preprocessing to get it in a shape suitable for fitting a machine learning model.

If you are looking for courses which allow you to apply what have you learned in practical problems, this is a very good option to consider. I liked how this course is structured, it teaches you the theory first, and then ask you to use what you have just learned (of course, not 100% coverage), which definitely provides a valuable learning experience. Highly recommended for someone who is interested in data science in general.",5
6024,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Kartik G,"Oct 30, 2019","Although the course is great from a theoretical point of view, but it has two major flaws. First, it doesn't provide the fundamentals of Machine Learning but instead directly moves to Deep Learning, although building those concepts from ground up. Also, from a practical point of view, this course is really lacking as there is not a single explanation video on any of the coding aspect of Deep Learning and the videos that even exist just ask us to read through the Documentation to learn the practical aspect.",3
6025,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Lewis C L,"Apr 23, 2019","Much weaker than Stanford offerings.  Strange buildup of topics for a breezy, but not particular accurate understanding.  For example:  multiple layers of a neural network is introduced before multiple category classification.  Transfer learning is introduced incorrectly. The matrix representation of multiple features of an example with multiple examples is introduced very late in the course. The instructor is conscientious and seemingly knows the material despite using non-standard terminology.  One wonders if he is primarily a teacher/researcher and rarely a practitioner.  One wonders if Duke is a leader in machine learning research.",2
6026,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Casper v d V,"Jan 2, 2021","The course is okay, the teaching is helpful explaining the concepts of machine learning well.

6038,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Witold D,"Dec 28, 2022","Good introductory course, quizzes are alright, but the coding  assignments are a fail. 
I liked the videos, they give a founded overview over the mathematical and conceptual foundations. In fact, you can watch at 1.25x speed with no problems. 
The course skips topics like decision trees, knn, and r regressions other  than logistic regression, as that is the basis for neural networks. But it's all good, there's another course here tha covers these. NNs and applications are covered well. 
Quizzes are good, sometimes a bit ambiguous, but if you pay attention to the videos, well doable. 
My biggest problem with this course is the programming assignments. I think they display a complete lack of didactical effort or understanding of their students' perspective. 
I'm not talking about suggesting a python version from 2019 or so, that is incompatible with latest libraries which are also necessary for the exercises. Also the (recommended) Anaconda is probably the worst package manager ever known to mankind, I'm not going into detail. I ended up doing pip and it worked fine, just sorry for the lost time. 
The biggest problem I had was the coding assignments. The labs just present some code examples and go like ""you figure out the rest of it"". Not even hints or some master solution to look it up, after trying by oneself for several days.
And even if you figure it out in the end, you're still left guessing why your 4 layer network does 96% accuracy, while the two layer network from the example does 99%. No comment, not even a ballpark figure how it should perform. 
There is some help in the forums, but to me the descussions there show that most people are struggling with that. 
Even having a reasonable background in linear algebra from uni and some Python experience I ended up  looking up stackoverflow and other resources for hours. Especially the NLP assignment cost me several days, bc the lab creators think it's good to swap a few dimensions in the input, as opposed to the rest of the internet apparently.  And skip over the batching in RNNs, because, yeah you go figure it out. 
In summary, I'm  not really convinced about this one.  
On the one hand, good intro to understand the concepts and applications and you can finish in like two weeks, depending on how well you do on the labs, And of course if you can spend 1-2hrs per day on videos and quizzes. 
On the other hand, the conding assignments are frustrating as hell and I don't feel like I got any routine in pytorch. I guess more, but simpler coding tasks separating individual aspects, and some kind of help to get to a solutions, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. ",3

6061,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Sean C,"Dec 24, 2020","Labs are great hands-on training, but the lectures and lab texts don't sufficiently prepare the student for the assignments. Watching them and reading the text will not give the student the skills to solve the assignments, forcing the student to search online for a better tutorial. I recommend providing the complete code to create a MLP, CNN, SWEM, RNN, LSTM and GRU. 
With a basic template created, the lab questions can then have the student change epochs, batch sizes, etc.
I am aware that some basic templates were provided, but providing a SWEM and having the student convert it to a RNN is a huge jump. I took detailed notes during lectures and read the lab notes, but ultimately had to find other resources to complete the assignments, because the answers were not provided by this course.

There are several lab exercise assignments at the end of each module.  
One down side is that the graded exams and quizzes don't come with full explanations of why the correct answer  is correct or why the wrong answer is wrong.

He reviews and summarizes material.   If you want to understand the theory and innards of machine learning algorithms this is a great course for you.,5
6095,Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University,Ju-Chieh L,"Aug 10, 2021","Overall, it's a good course! But I strongly suggest that the title of the course should be changed!

The programming exercises do not follow the lectures and it does not build upon concepts.  You will be required to seek help elsewhere (i.e., Stack Overflow) and answers to your questions will take days, if not longer.

1) what is the problem we are facing?
2) how can we solve that problem (practically)?
3) how and why does this solution work (theoretically)?
this is proven to be much easier to learn new things and get started. Instead i think this course is set-up for people to struggle by themselves, which i find very frustrating and its not teaching! I ended up teaching myself through trial and error and lots of google search. So what am i paying you for then?

6159,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Brian W,"Feb 20, 2017",Damn near worthless. The course material has significant gaps of information. The programming assignments require knowledge that isn't presented in the course. I had to Google my way through this entire course. I would not recommend it.,1
6160,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,John C S,"Jul 12, 2017","Let me start by saying that I did learn some basics of R programming during this course with a lot of help from friends and fellow classmates.
I like to believe that my 20+ professional years in education and training design and delivery have left me with a pretty good understanding of adult learners, learning theory, and putting all of that into practice. With that in mind, here are a couple of points.
First, there is no prerequisite knowledge, skill, or course listed as required for this specialization. Here's what Coursera says about background knowledge, ""Some programming experience (in any language) is recommended. We also suggest a working knowledge of mathematics up to algebra (neither calculus or linear algebra are required)."" Great! My limited working knowledge of BASIC from the 1980s and novice ability with MS VB fit the bill. Math? No problem, got it covered with Algebra 2 30 years ago. But wait, it turns out neither of those are the case because there are pinned posts in the forum that say the author doesn't understand why an understanding of linear algebra isn't required because it would be really helpful, and you yourself make the point that, ""Yes, the mathematics in Statistical Inference and Regression Models are tough for students who haven't previously studied statistics."" Knowledge of statistics isn't required or even recommended for this specialization Mr. Greski. That's poor curriculum design and setting students up to fail because there is no realistic expectation set as to what they face in this.
Second, if the materials do not provide any framework or context to tie the assignments to previously taught content either in ""lecture"", swirl, or assignments, then the course designers and instructors did an incredibly poor job with the design. How can students, even those who have a background in statistics, be reasonably expected to know when an assignment makes use of information or learning that must be found outside of the course itself? This can easily be fixed by including a statement or section with each assignment that says something like, ""This assignment covers material found in Lessons, x, y, and z. You will also need information found in sources outside this course such as datacamp.com, etc."" The italicized sentence can be the same in every assignment. The paragraph could even say that the assignment is not connected to the current lesson in any way as the intent is for the student to make use of outside resources (or whatever the approriate intent is). Regardless, every graded assignment should have a purpose stating what the student should get out of it, and they could all benefit from a context statement.
Third, if people like me (those with a non-statistics/mathematics background) are not part of the target audience, then please define the target audience better. Currently, Coursera says this, ""Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required."" That makes it sound like it is appropriate for anyone with no background knowledge or experience because the course will provide all the background knowledge and skills needed along the way. I'm willing to bet that the full program for $3,310 at JHU has prerequisites other than ""Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required,"" and ""Some programming experience (in any language) is recommended. We also suggest a working knowledge of mathematics up to algebra (neither calculus or linear algebra are required).""
Finally, portions of this specialization that I have completed so far are out of date. There was one quiz question that involves a specific package in R that is not compatible with the latest version of R. That forces the student to guess. Of course, we can take the quizzes over and over again if we are patient enough so it doesn't really matter if we are guessing on the answers or actually learning and getting the correct answers. Does it? While $49/month may not seem like a lot of money to some people, for others it could be quite a bit if they are having difficulty finding a job and working to improve their skill sets and qualifications. Even though it is ""just"" $49/month, we are paying for what we presume to be a quality product from a top-notch university. I don't think it's too much to ask that someone correct all the various errors, keep the materials up-to-date with the current version of R (once a year at least), and review feedback such as this (and others) in the forums and Coursera comments. Yes, this means someone has to put the time in on that type of work. I can honestly say that the current state of the materials and quality of design and delivery are well below what I expected for a JHU associated product. I'm not sure I can recommend this to someone as an introduction to data science as it currently exists. I wouldn't be surprised if JHU as an Instructional Design program that could use something like this as a capstone project or similar effort.
I sincerely appreciate the time that the JHU staff, the folks volunteering as mentors, my fellow classmates, and my neighbor give to help me and other students understand the concepts and skills in this course. Our expressed frustration about not seeing a connection between assignments and lectures is not an expressed desire to have our hands held and be spoon fed. It's a frustration at wanting to understand the materials, how they fit together, and how we can use them, which I believe is the intent of education and training in general. Hopefully, Dr. Peng or someone from JHU will see this feedback and be interested in making improvements to the curriculum.",2
6161,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Laknath,"Apr 18, 2019","I would be cautious to recommend this course to a complete beginner. I had been using R for about 6 months before starting this course and found the content challenging. For instance, topics like lexical scoping covered in this course are usually tackled in a more Advanced R course. For a complete beginner into R, I would recommend a book like ""R in Action"" by Robert Kabacoff or the course on Udemy by Jose Portilla.
However, if you have had some exposure to R and would like it to take it to the next level, this is an excellent course. It will force you to learn things on your own. Read the documentation of R functions, peruse through stack overflow and really step up your game.",4

The reason is that the assignments and final is extremely difficult and they do not connect so much to lecture videos.

6177,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Amy G,"May 24, 2020","At first glance, the lectures seemed great - they explain the chosen lecture material well and give you a good background on the basic building blocks and theory of R. The quizzes were also pretty good because they directly test you on the lectures and help reinforce the key ideas.
The problem with this course is the assignments. While the assignments are well-made in themselves and would otherwise help you learn by doing, they have little to no correlation with anything covered in the lectures for that particular week - or, if they do, it is not made sufficiently clear, even in hindsight.
This is not a fatal flaw learning-wise, because you can dig around in the forums/elsewhere on the internet for tutorials and explanations of the concepts you need to do the assignments, and through this you can still learn the intended material. I do feel like I've walked away from this course having learned what the instructor meant for me to learn about R.
But it does beg the question - if 80% of the essential material for succeeding in this course must be found by scouring outside websites and extra articles posted by former students in the forums, then what exactly am I paying for?
Furthermore, it seems I am not the only one who feels this way - more than once in this course I found a post from a mentor in the forums containing a random article from elsewhere on the web, with the caption ""many students have said they are confused about [topic], so for the purposes of the assignment, consider this the 'missing lecture' from this week."" For a free course/completely self-taught approach, this would be fine, but as part of a paid specialization, the extremely large gap between the given material and the assessments was deeply frustrating.
I understand that to learn programming is, to a certain extent, to learn by doing, and to learn how to take the theoretical information that was imparted in class and apply it to a new or different problem that is presented as an exercise. However, when, after taking diligent notes on all of the week's lectures and completing all 15 extra-credit swirl exercises twice just to make sure I haven't missed anything, I am still left wondering if the assignment in front of me was uploaded to the wrong course by the instructor by mistake, something has gone quite awry in the course design.

However... the programming assignments were extremely difficult to the point of being almost impossible to complete without an enourmous amount of external help and research. They were way beyond the diffiulty level appropriate for the course and were impossible to complete or even understand with the information covered in the lectures and exercises. It was very discouraging at the start and I almost condiered giving up until I read other reviews and saw that many people were having the exact same issues that I was. 
I think it is completely unacceptable to have assignments that are so beyond the difficulty level of the course that they are essentially irrelevant to the learning outcomes of the course.

6197,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,James M I,"Apr 15, 2016","Great course to start getting your hands into R. While the lectures are OK and the Swirl exercises are great, the course falls a bit short in building you up to tackling the weekly programming assignments. I had to spend a lot of time researching on my own to complete the assignments. I don't mind that, but I could do that on my own without paying for the course. I'm paying because I want to learn R quickly without spending hours researching what could have easily been described in the lectures. A lot of times, the course mentors in the discussion forums provided the best guidance. I would have liked each programming exercise to build upon the last one, so that at the end of the course I would have a great R product to review later. As it is, each programming assignment can stand on its own. When learning to programming in a new language, I prefer small, quick victories that build upon one another to accomplish a great task. This is the reason for not giving full 5-stars. Otherwise, Dr. Peng does a good job at providing material.

Cons: 1) Some of the assignments introduce concepts that are not covered in the lectures, and are not well explained (if at all) in the assignment instructions. Not impossible, but you will have to do a fair bit of Googling to figure it out. 2) A couple of the lectures assume you have a reasonably advanced knowledge of statistics. If you don't, it's hard to follow along with the R principles that are being demonstrated. 3) One of the assignments is peer-reviewed.

Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction. The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative, but the assignments are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience. Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete. 
Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after they're submitted. So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material. 
I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses. I feel like I wasted $49.",1

The philosophy underlying the modular system in Coursera is clearly that the subject matter covered in the module relates to the set work for that module. I was only able to complete work for week x after doing the reading for week x+1. It took me some time to discover this strategy, a lot of which was wasted wondering what I was missing, what I had done wrong &c. I'm sure the course fee doesn't mean much to most but it is a significant amount to me and I felt let down. Very little time or thought has gone into the structure of this course. It is clear that something is wrong with the week 3 assignment when there are git hub entries on the background knowledge required to complete it. Without these I would not have managed. Going by the age of some of these entries, this problem is now years old with no attempt made to rectify it.
My only reason for persisting with the course is that my boss asked me get the certificate. I imagine his assumption was that the quality must be high given the institution sponsoring it.

First of all course has too much information without the applying during the weeks. However once a learner opens the assignment it is inevitable to face with very hard tasks
I spent more time on youtube and other sources to learn how to use the functions and solve the assignments in comparison with the course itself. That is the reason I am not satisfied with the course.
Given theory is okay but the applying of them during the week is very less. THat is the reason learner face big issues during quizzes.
I found SWIRL assignments very useful that I can say they were the only things that I learned the practical part of R programming.
My advice is to increase the number of SWIRL assignments and increase the difficulty level of them each time.

Are you kidding me???

Video Lectures : The speed and content are just perfect. The concepts covered in each lecture and the manner in which it was taught just made them stick well in my mind.

Unlike other online tutorial sites, lectures in this module helped me understand how R thinks and works. Lexical scoping was particularly difficult to understand at first, and I also had to rewatch it a few times, but it did help me a lot in actually learning the language. I also like how the programming assignments are laid out as ""machine problems"" wherein students are asked to create functions that also require us to search for other functions on our own. The swirl exercises were also particularly helpful for me in remembering some useful functions that I would later use for the programming assignments.

This course is basically trial by fire, but at the end of it, I am surprised how much I have learned about R. One suggestion I have for students is this: do not just write the code for the functions from the assignments. Play around with the different functions by writing your own codes. Here are some ideas: write a code that takes in two numeric values and one letter that each represent the corresponding sides of a right triangle.  Your code should calculate the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem. Also, write a code that solves a quadratic equation in standard form given three numeric values as elements in a vector (where each element = its respective leading coefficient). Finally, write a code that takes any numeric matrix with dimension [3:n] and runs each column of the matrix through the quadratic formula. Doing this really helped my understanding of the split and lapply commands. ",5

It has the right level of difficulty and the instructor, Roger Peng is amazing. He's very excited about the subject and his energy helps to motivate you throughout the course.
Maybe just a little bit of programming experience is required (just thinking in programming terms or knowing the basic functions). But really, I believe anyone with motivation, patience (you're gonna need this last one haha), and focus can pass this course without a problem.

I was already somewhat familiar with R but I now feel much more confident in my R programming skills. I am glad this course was not exclusively helpful for people just starting with R. I learned many new things and I sometimes struggled with some of the assignments (especially week 3 programming assignment) and they pushed me to understand more complicated concepts, which I was really happy about.
I thought the swirl library was also really helpful. It solidified what we'd learned in the video lectures, and sometimes delved into things I had not seen before or things we had seen before but with more detail, such as ellipses (as arguments in functions), definition of binary operations and simulations of coin flips.
The only part I was not interested in is the history of R at the beginning of the course. I didn't really care for it, but I think I understand why it's there.

O que não é algo ruim, pois no dia a dia, iremos nos deparar procurando novas informações e metodologias mais atuais para fazermos algo de uma forma mais eficiente.    ",5

A little knowledge of R programming before this course is helpful as that might help understand the slides better.

I had to read from tons of other external sources just to complete the programming assignments on my own. Even the very cool self-paced, hands-on R-tutorial (Swirl) didn't help much in equipping me with the skills to easily complete the assignments. The instructor is very qualified to deliver the course, but the manner of delivery is overwhelming for a beginner in R (or programming. 
Overall, I began with zero/very minimal programming skills and ended up with quite a decent background in R programming by the course's end. If you have zero programming background, do not take this course.",4

I found the course to be challenging enough, and equally rewarding. The swirl exercises are good and help you practice the commands in a guided setting. The programming assignments were very challenging. I ended up working on them for 7-8 hours on average. Assignments were designed to make you investigate and study on your own (this really helped in my understanding of R).

As mentioned by many other learners, the projects from the course is beyond what we had learned from the videos (the videos are quite fundamental and are useful to beginners, except the lexical scoping part which I still do not understand even with the project assignment two), which is why I am giving three stars. However, it exposes us to the real working environment when you are given a project without any guides. We are required to think independently how should we tackle such kind of situation when we are facing programming problem. You may have the idea but you do not know how to code it. Then you go through forums, be it Coursera forum or StackOverflow. You will enjoy the hard time when you are stuck and when you do not understand the forum contents. But you will also enjoy the sweet time when you have finally figured out the codes that work! The course is recommended for those who like to accept the challenge.",3
6249,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Konstantinos L,"Sep 3, 2021","I learned a lot of things in this course, but I can't say that I'm pleased with the course overall. 

First of all, I found really frustrating that there was no connection between assignments and each week theory with a huge difficulty leap between them. Secondly, videos was kind of useless as the tutor was just reading the slides, and thirdly there was no consistency between each week curriculum, it lacked coherence. 

Even so, I learned a lot of things, and after all this frustration I find myself more confident in using R language. In addition, the tutors are present in the discussion forum and they are really really helpful, answering questions and provide extra material for the assignments, which in my opinion should be integrated in the main course. 

If this course was a couple of weeks longer, and there was consistency  between theory - assignments, I think that it would be much better.",3
6250,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Jesus A P G,"May 2, 2020","In short, I learned a lot in this cocurse but I would not consider it for beginners with little programming experience. I spent at least 3-5 times more doing the assingtments. The information presented was very valuable but the pedagogical part was not well done. The chunks of information were poorly connected between themselves, making the learning process tidous and hard to achieve. The visuals were very sloppy with only white slides and a font too small. For these reason the lectures were boring and unappealing. My suggestion is to take more care of the didactic aspect of the course. Many times I had to watch YouTube videos on the same topic that I had just seen, and I can say that a colored diagram made all the difference between understanding everything and not understanding nothing at all.",3

So much so that I didn't have to tools to approach the assignments with what I feel comfortable using. This is a huge detriment to the learning objectives of the course.
At several points, I contemplated quitting because of this consideration. I imagine it is a huge hurdle. I have no coding experience, but I am traditionally a good student so this is frustrating.

I completely understand not being ""spoon fed"", which is a critical aspect of learning anything on your own. However, the jump in expectations between Programming Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 was incomprehensible. You could work your way through #2 but with #3, it felt as though you had a plethora of information thrown at your way, adding to the confusion, which you then had to stare at for what felt like ""light years"" to fully decode, in order to get through the quiz.

It is impractical for people who have just been introduced to R(with no background in programming) to take up this course. 
The graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help first-timers get used to coding in R. I do not think Swirl; even though a valuable resource; achieves this task remotely.",3
6254,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Kylie A,"Jun 16, 2021","The level of teaching does not match the level of the assignments. They teach you like you're just going to be quizzed on the vocab and some really simple functions, but then the programming assignments are WAY more complicated than anything they actually taught you. I get that in data science we are supposed to learn how to solve problems, but the instructors shouldn't be intentionally creating problems where we have to go and spend many hours teaching ourselves the material just so we can pass.",3
6255,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Jill M W,"Nov 17, 2016","It was a little difficult grasping functions as I didn't have much programming background. The swirl practice modules were great but I wish they constructed some lessons that would build a function from top to bottom like we were asked to do in the programming assignments. The lectures, swirl practice modules, and quizzes were great but they all re-iterated the same basic information. I wanted to learn and practice building more functions by applying the basic information to do complex tasks.",3
6256,R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Abigail T,"Aug 4, 2021","The course is OK. This biggest frustration was that lectures were quite unhelpful for the programming assignments they give you. They are not engaging and get very technical very quickly.

I understand that there is always a gap between lecture and application; however, I should not have to sift through a dozen discussion posts to figure out what is going on in the assignments.  Students should be able to complete them with just the functions that were covered in the course materials, otherwise, the course materials are insufficient. 
My degree is in education and if I had so poorly prepared my students to complete their assignments, then I would get in a lot of trouble. It seems like this has been a complaint for some time and there have been efforts to improve through the resources provided in the forum, but this calls for either rewriting the assessments so they align better with the content that was covered or a fundamental restructuring of the course content so students are prepared to complete the assessments as currently written.",2

The autograder system on the programming assignments in the three University of Colorado Boulder statistics courses that I've enrolled in is like something from a Kafka novel.  It does not provide feedback on which questions it's marking incorrect, and Jupyter notebooks are unreliable in their rention of updates.  That can compound with errors in the assignments themselves and a nearly deserted discussion forum for a really rough time.
There's not enough student course work to make me confident in my mastery of the material or in the retention of it.
It would be nice to have some reference material other than the lecture slides.

6299,Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning by IBM,peker m,"Dec 1, 2020","This particular course as many others in Coursera, provides minimum possible knowledge with the lowest level of course quality. I will elaborate my point as following;
1) Instructor does not even know the actual mathematical foundations of what he is presenting. He provides example notebooks supposedly process a particular data which does even not exist. I personally and very discretely provided my comments regarding his conceptual mistakes in his presentations without receiving yet any feedback or observing a change in course material.
2) The final projects, even though presenters make money out of this course, are evaluated by peers. With that in hand I have a PhD in Physics, but somehow a random course taker who did not even acquire 10% of my math and coding throughout his/her education is evaluating my final project. Moreover, this person does not even understand well what is written in my project and gives me some random grades. As a result, I don't even get a feedback at all about my grade and or details of his/her grading. 
Now, let me put these together. Coursera was a go-to place back in time. Nowadays its quality is not even close to be called 'mediocre'. I had the belief that at least some information can be gained and somehow it was worth taking class(es) back in time. After this horrible and totally not valuable experience, I do not think Coursera is doing a notable or at least an average job. I also have no faith in the comments that you guys publish here from your course takers. I have no reasons to believe them.

To the point where the projects are unable to be completed, without the help from one or two forum posts from a random student who has spent the time to find a solution. This is a growing problem with IBM's courses. I've learned more from other students, finding workarounds for your mess, than I have from the actual course work. Also, the content for this course, and any examples of code, was produced in Jupyter Notebooks. You didn't even create content in your own IDE, IBM Watson Studio, which says everything a student needs to know about IBM products. ",1

6324,Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning by IBM,EMANUELE F,"Sep 26, 2021","The course touches all the topics that are of interest for the a Machine Learning pratictioneer. I've found the course sometimes oversimplified, that paradoxically made it harder to grasp some concepts, expecially the topics of the Week 2. Overall I've found It to be a good course because at least it gives you the path to follow from where you can study on your own to go deeper in the topics you are interested.
Note: I would suggest to edit the notebooks. It is not a good idea to have the solutions in the same notebook where you should do an exericise, because it makes also the video lectures that came after pretty useless. I suggest to separate the exercises from the solutions, and to put the solutions in the video lectures so you must follow them with some focus to understand what the solution was. Furhtermore i would review the notebooks. Some of them were different from the ones presented in the video lectures which made it a little bit confusing to follow.",4

Sometimes although I found the contents being spoken in the video hard to understand because of the flow and the accent, but then reading the subtitles helped. Also, one suggestion would be to provide a presentation or some pdf documents for the most commonly used Python commands for various libraries like Pandas etc. for data handling (starting from data reading, cleaning upto hypothesis testing and further). This is because to makes hand notes of all the commands from the demo videos takes quite some time.

6425,Data Science as a Field by University of Colorado Boulder,Luis E V,"May 2, 2022","The class fails to teach most of what it asks for the assignments. In the requirements, only a basic understanding of R was  noted, while in reality most of the assignments require you to have an, at least, intermediate understanding of R and how different R libraries work. What's worst is that none is this is really taught, but really it just feels as a very shallow, incomplete, guidethrough of 10% of the whole process.

But, it then divulges into using R to read in data, clean it and create R markdown documents for analysis. This was a fun project, but the instructor does not really teach anything here. They just use an example that is not related to the data in the project, and then they just copy and paste some R commands into the console.

To add, there's no waffling here, examples are fine-tuned to the scenario and  easy to go along with, and I've noticed that each course is structured differently depending on the person who created it (I'm assuming it's the lecturer/presenter) - but, whoever it is, they have done a good job scaffolding this course effectively.

6485,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Deleted A,"Mar 26, 2016","One thing I regret from this course is the content of the video lectures. Having watch the first week's videos, I found that the professor mostly just read the slides - and did it in a very faithful and careful manner, not to miss a subscript .... This is quite devastating for me. I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small). What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.
I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first week's videos add up to a mere 36 minutes. A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level. That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week. Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didn't read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time. That approach really helped scaffold my learning.
I hope you'd consider revisiting this course's learning plan - or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one.",2

6500,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Munirul N,"Aug 1, 2016","I find this course excellent. It is a well balanced course in combining econometric theory and its application. The fact is that to apply econometric theory one needs to understand  fair bit of econometric method (that includes matrix algebra, some properties of  inner product space etc.) as well as how to apply those concepts in practice. In this respect this course does serve its purpose very well. 
Overall, this course focuses some fundamental aspects  and properties of cross-sectional data and time series data. Therefore, it provides one  a good foundation (over 8 weeks) so that one can carry out one's future quest regarding any empirical topic by oneself ! I admit that modern econometric theory develops more sophisticated techniques but all of them share one common aspect i.e. they are based on more or less the same fundamentals or properties. Indeed, this course has been designed carefully by targeting  those fundamentals  and properties. Thus it might be very helpful to follow the modern econometric techniques.
However, this course does not talk about the panel data analysis, which share both the cross-sectional and time series properties (more or less). In my opinion it might be better to have at least additional one week session on panel data. In particular, when the data set shares both cross-sectional and time series properties, which  set of properties will  be dominant or how the estimation technique incorporates the variation of two dimensions (i.e. cross-sectional  and time ) etc. 
 Finally, I like to thank all the teaching members  and moderators of this course. I have enjoyed the lecture slides  and videos very much.

This is an outstanding course that covers some common topics in econometrics in good detail. While the course tries to develop your intuition, there is also some work applied to mathematical proofs.  The only minor complaint that I have is that it still lacks some material on how to apply the methods using common programming languages or statistical software.

6515,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Sergio G,"Apr 21, 2020","Overall, it was a good project. The use of real datasets made the learning experience so much rich. 
Pros: it is very rigurous. If one pays enough attention, it will provide the necessary knowledge to perform robust analysis. Linear regressions ara a basic algortithm. Still, most of the time people do not know how to use them properly.
Cons: the explanations are poor. The slides are sometimes quite unclear. This course would benefit a lot if it had guided implementations. Also, something that I really disliked was that the solutions for the tests (which you use to review others in peer activities) were extremely simple and vague. It seems as if they were made carelessly. From test 1, the course should instill the importance of the analysis, rather than getting the calculations correct.

6525,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Serge d V,"Apr 24, 2016","Very useful course for those who want to learn what is behind econometric tools and what their limitations are. The combination between practice and theory makes it an exciting learning experience that is worth the time investment. For those, like myself, that were not 100% up to speed at the start, a significant time investment is needed. To finish the course I had to spend in excess of 20 hours a week to satisfactorily understand the material and be able to reproduce the main takeaways. I am sure the course can be successfully completed with less effort, but grasping the essence of the material made sense to me as I am trying to get a better idea of how to use econometric tools. Conclusion: it is completely worth your time, but if you are not sufficiently well versed in math and statistics, basic college level, you will need to make a significant time investment to make full use of the material.",5
6526,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Ke-Chung "" L","Mar 14, 2017","This course is great and satisfying. It's also challenging and demanding. It teaches you how to apply regression and time series to build model for forecasting real world events. It also requires you to have certain level of calculus, linear algebra and statistics to understand the underlying theory. Besides, statistics tools, like R, SPSS or Excel (of your choice), is a must for you to do exercises and projects. Studying all those videos, slides and exercise would take you many hours a week, but you will be very satisfying with modeling skills and working knowledge of time series learned from the course. Studying this course is a wonderful and unforgettable experience for me. I strongly recommend it to those who want to build a solid foundation of modeling data (not only economical data).",5
6527,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Emanuel M,"Mar 8, 2021","In top three best courses on Coursera that I have taken and have gone through quite a few. It has the best exercise sheets I have seen, with actual both math and programming tasks to do and base own reports on, which are afterwards peer reviewed. The course is both theoretically and practically complete and sound for the topic, giving really good background in it. I have checked courses on this topic on other platforms and this one covers pretty much all of it and into a math debt that is enough to get a good grasp of what is going on. From then on, you have the sufficient background to continue on your own.
I can't think of a course that I would recommend more.",5
6528,Econometrics: Methods and Applications by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Khiem N T,"Feb 23, 2016","I like the structure of the course that different professor is in charge of different chapter but the contents of each chapter are linked to the others.

In addition, the guideline and syllabus provide students with great details. On top of that,  chapter assignments are provided with solution which are necessary for students to check their knowledge.
I would love to participate in follow up course which might deal with more advanced topics after this basic one.",5

Theoretical material is well explained, and practical exercises are nicely tied with the theory.  Optional homeworks are well-designed interesting to solve, and they too are quite helpful for the respective final assignment of each week. The time series material was a little disappointing -only passing references to ARMA model theory in full and MLE estimation for such models, but the explanation of ADL models was very good. I was very satisfied in general with the course and the work of the Instructors and the TA's who provided solutions for the homework. Recommended!",5

Case Study in the last week. The course indeed helped me a lot to refresh theoretical knowledge that I learned nearly 2.5 decades ago during graduation/ master degree in Statistics. It's worth trying if you are interested and comfortable with statistical software (Stata, SAS, R) or Excel with add-ins (eg RealStats). Although I use Stata on a daily basis, I solved all problems in Excel Data Analysis and RealStats add-in in order to understand each steps clearly. ",5

Really useful hardskills, well explained by the teaching team, I recommend it.

6750,Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships by Google,Matthew B,"Jul 7, 2023","A massive fall from the previous course (The power of Statistics) both in terms of scaffolding (especially with the Python labs) and accessibility. The key concepts that are explored within the videos, are certainly difficult to grasp but the main issue stems from the lecturer's inability to go over the basics of a concept and link it with a simple scenario to cement any foundational learning. 
Terms, explanations, questions found within the practice exams and end-of-week challenges are almost shoe-horned in with very little exposure within the documentation/videos. This course is equivalent to being taught in a lesson by a teacher who passes you a textbook and tells you to read, and do all of the tasks, from a certain page. Finally, the lecturer seems almost like she doesn't want to be there/nervous when all they are doing is reading from a prompt.",2
6751,Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships by Google,CHONG L,"Jul 14, 2023",I don't enjoy this part of the course as much as other parts. The instructor reads scripts like a robot. Week 4 and 5 are quite abstract. Many concepts just show the definitions without examples.,2
6752,Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships by Google,Sayed H,"Aug 9, 2023","This is one of the worst course instructor I have ever seen. She's sitting still like a robot throughout the entire course. Completely visible that she's reading a script, looking over the screen. Seems like she dosen't wanted to be here in the first place. I was wondering the entire course, how the videos were approved in the final assesment? How come no one noticed the weirdest possible eye contact? I think she shouldn't conduct any other course ever.",1

6755,Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships by Google,Nilesh K,"Oct 20, 2023","Disappointed with this module. I understand that there was too much to cover. But the module could have been extended. The practice lab and the project lab were vastly different. It was like learning basic arithmetic operations and being tested on calculus. The EDA steps during the project lab were not explored before, while there were ample opportunities. It is hard for a beginner to follow along. The tools used during the learning labs were not used in the project lab. Whole different tools were used. 
I did not learn a thing and I have to follow external resources to get my head around the concepts now.",2
6756,Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships by Google,John E,"Apr 26, 2023","The materials and presentations are excellent, but I am not a fan of the busy work involved in the end of course PACE portfolio work. Professional presentation is certainly important, but you end up diluting the course by including so much of this material. Furthermore, having worked on many projects, I can tell you that the workflow process is so iterative that trying to ""shoe horn"" the process into a four letter acronym -- which is better than the six letter acronym in the previous specialization -- is both reductionistic and frankly artificial.  My suggestions are as follows: remove this excess material and ""re-factor"" the PACE/portfolio material into one course, perhaps the capstone course. Otherwise, I learned quite a bit.",5

The end-of-course project offered a valuable opportunity to apply the newly acquired knowledge in a practical setting. I appreciate the clear explanations, real-world examples, and interactive exercises that made the learning experience engaging and impactful.

It reinforced the value of assessing assumptions and model accuracy. My understanding of hypothesis tests has deepened, as I learned how to use them to evaluate the significance of individual predictors. One interesting aspect I discovered was the potential for multicollinearity, where independent variables can be correlated, leading to unstable coefficient estimates and making interpretation challenging. This project highlighted the need for careful variable selection and assessment of assumptions in regression analysis.",5

1) The enunciation was unclear and subtitles were often of-the-point, plus they covered-up the code lines that were being discussed.
2) The lecturer often failed to explain logical constructs that were being used, despite the fact that the course should have been understandable with no R cran/Bioconductor experience.
3) The method arguments were either not explained, or very vaguely mentioned, which means applying them to new situations was unnecessarily complicated.
4) No feedback at all was offered from course organisers/reps to anyone, even after complains in discussion forum about quiz questions.
5) No feedback for solving the questions/correct answers even after the deadline.
6) Quiz questions required methods and logical constructs that were not explained/used/mentioned in the lectures. One quiz lacked background information of what data needed to be used (the info was available in the previous version of the course). Some quiz questions were biologically inaccurate i.e. confusing genes/transcripts/exons.",1

Since Use of R and Bioconductor can be tricky, it would be nice if better examples were much more elaborated.
The Quizzes have a lot of questions, which are too difficult to answers, generally because the revolve around using 10% of the introduced material to do 90% unexplained analysis.

There are ample materials, in the form of slides, videos and code, as well as a textbook whose chapters are in the instructors archives and also  available  in pdf form on the Internet.  
Key to understanding the material is knowledge of the structure of the Genome, DNA and RNA.  Knowledge of transcripts, Exons, Introns, and other data structures is assumed.

I was only able to complete the course through a multitude of sources, including the Coursera weekly help forums and the various Bioconductor forums.

6906,Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Healthcare by Stanford University,Derek E,"Nov 8, 2020","Not really a course for beginners looking to understand ML.  Overall, the course provides a good overview of ML in healthcare, but when it comes to actually explaining ML, it is more of a quick review.   Lectures have far too much unexplained jargon and tend to talk around or gloss over key concepts. Lectures in weeks 2-4 were oddly repetitive and lacked a logical step by step flow.  Instructors also read the script too fast at times.  If they slowed down, spent an extra minute or two to explain the underlying ideas, it would have made a big difference.  Correcting errors in the slides and providing more coursework would help too.  For beginners looking for better non-technical explanations of AI/ML I'd highly recommend looking up Professors Andrew Ng and Melanie Mitchell.    ",3

I have background already in ML and it helped me reinforce concepts as well as learn an overall point of view of health related benefits, opportunities, use cases, challenges and risks. Very valuable information for an introductory course.
However, for people completely new to ML, I think it could be challenging to follow all the concepts that are presented. Coding is not required nor deep math; in fact, instructors do a great work trying to abstract the details in order to explain the concepts. But in ML, some of the topics require more depth and background in order to be able to fully grasp the idea. So if this is your case, it could be good to get some extra content from elsewhere on the basics before or during the course.",5

7016,"Sequences, Time Series and Prediction by DeepLearning.AI",Asad K,"Jul 31, 2019","The first week has some interesting discussion of time series data and some traditional non-ML methods for forecasting, but beyond that the course quickly divulges the all too familiar weaknesses of this specialization; lack of depth, elementary discussion, weak insight into common problems that arise during training models, and extremely poorly written quizzes that don't test the learner's gain of knowledge or skills in any meaningful way.
My biggest complaint to the instructors and the team is that for months this specialization promised the last course will discuss the WaveNet model, but the course didn't even do a cursory survey of it (In week 4, the instructor adds a Conv1D layer but doesn't even discuss the causal padding and completely skips dilations, etc, so that in effect there isn't even discussion of a single layer from WaveNet model).

If you have no background of deep learning, going through some code snippets without any explanation wont help you at all. you  can't know anything behind it. If you already have some knowledge, you will find nothing new and more in this course. 1) The materials are so shallow and without any depth, just reading the slides and codes with errors. Only some high-level keras APIs are covered. The official tensorflow tutorial is much better. 2) The test questions are of no value at all, it cant test any your understanding whether about deep learning or the tool tensorflow. The assignments are poorly designed, the answers contains errors. 3) I strongly doubt the instructor, I think he does not have much ML experience.

I feel it was a waste of time: Hardly any new content, nothing that inspired me really beyond what I currently do. The quality of presentation IMHO was sub-par and of low-quality content. Laurence constantly stated how the MAE went down when it actually did not significantly at all. After a while, it sounded more like that he tried to influence the observer to believe that his model tweaks had a positive effect on the prediction accuracy when in reality it had hardly any effect at all. Also, at times I got the impression that Laurence did not really fully understand what he was doing, such as pushing up and down batch sizes, learning rates, flipping layer types back and forth. It did not appear to me that there was any thought process behind or logic applied to why he was doing what he was doing. Disappointed!!!
Quite disappointed about this sequence after the awesome other 3 courses taught by Andrew Ng. ",1

The course does not teach us about models like ARIMAX, ARIMA etc. Just some simple problems are solved in this course. Also, in the first three weeks, toy dataset was being used. The audio is also very low. There is no graded programming assignment. The quiz questions are also below standard.

The quizzes (1 quiz per week) are ridiculously easy, and the (ungraded) exercises are basically - ""do what we did in the lecture, only from memory"".
The material itself is good, but doesn't go in depth. They introduce Huber loss, and then tell you to go read about it in Wikipedia.

Stationarity is mentioned at the very beginning but then it fades as if it was completely irrelevant to ML. b) there is more than one contradiction in the presentation. MAE is going up yet the presenter says that it got better??? That I think would be really confusing, particularly for novice learners. c) black boxes: I acknowledge that there are so many decisions and choices one needs to make when setting up a training model.

7263,Probability Theory: Foundation for Data Science by University of Colorado Boulder,Cora M,"Nov 21, 2021","My rating applies to the first week, as I'm dropping after my experience with the first assignment. This is not a commentary on Prof. Dougherty, who seems like a teacher I'd really like to have in an in-person setting. It refers instead to the Gilliamesque homework submission and grading system. Before you join the class, be prepared:
All homework is submitted in an ipynb using an R kernel, and homework is autograded. The grader gives zero feedback regarding what was incorrect, not to mention why or what the correct answer is. All you get is the number of cells that didn't pass; when you reload the assignment, there is no indication of what was wrong.
As a math nerd troll, however, it's magnificent—the grading mechanism itself is a probability problem that provides one with hours of fun. By which I mean frustration.
I joined this class as a refresher, because I love probability. I'm dropping this course before that changes.",1

It's a little disappointing in an online course that I have to spend a majority of my time learning from videos on Youtube, khan academy and other statistics courses on coursera.

7270,Probability Theory: Foundation for Data Science by University of Colorado Boulder,Derek B,"Jun 19, 2022","Overall I thought this course was very good. The lectures were clear. I was even more impressed by the work that was put into designing different kinds of assignments. After completing them, I felt like I understood concepts and techniques much better than before.
That said, I have two big criticisms. First, I really did not like the textbook that was provided. It is supposed to be different from a traditional text book, in a way that makes it easier to understand, I guess. But honestly I thought it had the opposite effect. The non-traditional style made it harder to look up information I wanted to review. I ended up searching for other online sources for better explanations of what was going on.
Second, while I think the class is great on its own, it is part of the Statistical Inference Specialization, and it feels like there was a lack of coordination between the people designing this course and those designing the second course in the series. The second course seems to presuppose much more advanced understanding of probability distributions than this course provides. So while I think the course is great on its own, if you are expecting it to prepare you for the second course in the series, it honestly fails to do so.",4
7271,Probability Theory: Foundation for Data Science by University of Colorado Boulder,Michelle W,"Apr 30, 2022","The professor's instruction is clear and concise, but I wish there were more videos to expand on topics not discussed. The auto-graded assignments are painful since there is no feedback on which problem was wrong (hint: only do one problem at a time and submit to grader. it is painfully slow but this way you know how you did on each question). This course assumes you have basic familiarity with R and can do basic differentiation & integration. I would not recommend this as a first course in probability - this course is best for those who have had some exposure to probability already (E.g., undergraduate level course).",4

Pretty straightforward and foundational lessons for statistics.  I had to dock the 1 star though because of requiring a buggy platform such as proctorU for the for credit version.  Either proctorU has to improve a whole lot or this program should drop them and find a better online proctoring platform.  Or perhaps offer onsite testing services such as prometric of pearson vue.  Honestly, proctorU has a way to go to make the experience horror-free for the student to take the most important part of the course, ie final exam.   Well lets just say I had a very bad experience with it and I might have lost points because of it,( did not answer one question and ended my exam 20 min early just to end the horror and walk off my frustration).  ProctorU platform is just barely functional.  Their proctor might have just used fb messenger or zoom along with their pc screen viewer and their mouse and kb grabber, it probably would have been better... but i dont know just sharing my one and only experience of it, which was quite negative.

There was no detail in the later materials (Weeks 3 and 4) in uses/applications which made it virtually impossible to finish the course without spending an incredible amount of time outside of the class attempting to learn material. The early quizzes were not bioinformatics focused and required a fairly sophisticated level of machine learning to answer some of the questions. In regards to the later material, there should be much more detail. For example on learning how to create dictionaries. That was AWESOME! But nothing beyond how to create them and how to use them.

A dificuldade da avaliação final não condiz com a qualidade das aulas ministradas e a falta de exercícios voltados para a Ciência de Dados Genômicos faz com que o material seja de um curso de programação normal. O tópico mais importante (Biopython) foi abordado em apenas uma aula e sem muito aprofundamento. Enfim, achei o curso frustrante.
The professors keep reading a teleprompter, which greatly interferes with the didactics and the progress of the classes. Besides, it seems that they don't know what to say if they don't have what to read. The difficulty of the final exam is not compatible with the quality of the given classes, and the lack of exercises focused in Genomic Data Science makes the material a normal programming course.

7317,Python for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Alfred D,"May 10, 2021","I just completed this course. To start, it is advertised as an introductory course, but I personally think you need prior python experience to successfully complete and understand everything. On top of that, you need to do a lot of extra research and practice that is outside the scope of the course. This means, studying how to write basic python programs and understand how exactly programs work. The beginning of the course explains the python language and the basics, but a 10 minute lecture does not give you enough knowledge to complete and understand the quizzes. For me personally, I was able to complete most of the quizzes just from being fluent in python, but for a beginner, I can see them having a hard time and struggling. The final exam is actually fairly difficult for those who have never written proper programs or taken some type of python course. In short, I think the lectures do not provide enough guidance or knowledge to complete the assignments, instead, a lot of extra work and research is needed from your end. I still think the course is good in providing an introduction BUT only if you have a strong programming or python background. ",4

Students, this course is OK, but do not expect to be able to pass the final exam. It is the most terrible assessment I have ever seen in Coursera. 
The problems presented in Week 4 test required a coding and knowledge level simply not covered anywhere in the course. The questions required logic/programming knowledge and imagination that is magnitudes beyond the course level. This isn't even a question of studying or working harder.  I am a scientist with pretty solid Python knowledge and after slaving away at the week 4 exam for 15 hrs x 4 weeks, I was still unable to figure out completely.  Part of it is learning curve (like figuring out ORFs), part is that some of the exam answers are just WRONG (like the maximum ORF length questions) and part are just questions with absolutely no basis or precedent in the course (finding repeats of n sequence).  In the end I had to guess at the answers. The discussion forums were also useless with no help from teachers and no activity for many years. 
This course is a embarrassment for John Hopkins which is a brilliant institution otherwise. Please fix this exam because it is just not up to scratch. Shame on the Coursera admins for letting this course continue unfixed for so long.",2

This course also provided me some chances to practice (I also realized learning to program is all about practicing and solving the bugs), otherwise, there is no way to pass the quiz and final exam. In my own opinions, the only thing that can be improved for this course is to have some post-quiz feedback sessions to explain the difficult questions in the quiz, because some of the questions are not fully covered in the lectures, even if I got it correct, I'm still not sure that my understanding is correct.

7337,Python for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Дубів О В,"Nov 12, 2022","Pros: in general - pretty valuable course
Cons: Python-related material can be extended; I'm sure the lady on videos is a highly skilled professional, but she seems not comfortable on a video and probably  needs more engagement (we know how to read from slides); some tests were WRONG and I reported it
Exam: the worst part and almost vanished my desire to proceed with the course:
1) it's way too complex compared to the material given in lectures - I have professional experience in programming (PHP, MySQL, JS) but this Python exam took me about 6-8 hours to complete. It's not only because of Python I haven't got experience with - it's  also about other stuff I should know before submitting answers. I can't even imagine how students without programming skills can fulfill this exam sucessfully. It's like they teach you 2+2, and on exam they require to compute integrals.... 
2) exam questions (especially 3rd task) are vague. Samples given are very basic and don't show all the variety of edge cases and how to deal with them (i.e. nested ORF, what to do if we see one more Opened Codon etc) - it took most of exam's time to find some external learning resources and to know more theory. I used this resource also as a benchmark to know if what I get is correct: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/ and it saved me.
3) PLEASE add at least couple of correct answers for sample data (dna.example.fasta file) for students to test their data against something before going on exam. Also add some more description and proper sample cases about codones: i.e. how to trean multiple ORF sequences if inside are some open or closed codons - how to determine the longest etc.  ",4

Though I know Python, I went through it just to complete the certification. I understand that the lectures are beginner level, but they are quite dull and tedious to go through. 

In some of the lectures, it seemed like university professors were just recording lectures for the sake of recording them without trying to make them interactive and interesting.

In contrast, the final exam requires a decent amount of effort. It would have been nice if some of the problems asked in the final exam were covered in the lectures - it is better to build on concepts and reach the end goal instead of having basic boring lectures and then suddenly a reasonably difficult final exam.

I don't mind the difficult final exam - it was in fact refreshing, what I mind is the tedious hours of pointless lectures I had to go through which had nothing to do with the final exam. My guess is that people who're new to programming would have found it difficult to transition from such an average course content to a reasonably elaborate final exam.",2

The lectures are starting with basic programming knowledge but this is not enough to pass to quizes at all. You need much more exercise to understand the basic concepts. 
The course and the quizes have more potential. I wish they would care more about highlighting, formatting,readability and also correctness of the provided code snippets. The final exam was totally confusing - a sample file is provided for implementing the algorithms, but no solution is available for the asked questions.

However, I couldn't even register properly because my bank did not approve the transaction. It's not worth it to even try to fix that through the bank, because the course has been disappointing so far, and hence I don't trust the final test. They should just give you tasks to perform in Jupyter or RStudio, which is way simpler than going through all this Watson adventure. They should give these tasks throughout the course as well.

I have finished the excellent IBM Data Science Professional Certificate series on Coursera and wanted to improve my knowledge of scalable Data Science with this series. Unfortunately, the videos and advice are extensively outdated. Python 2 is used through this course and the instructions of how to set up Node-RED and Cloudant do not work. I have been trying to work myself around that but then again, I wouldn't need this course in the first place and it only leads to confusion. Also, instead of the Cloudant application UI, Kibana seems to be used now, which there is no introduction to. I have noticed that Romeo Kienzler, the course lead, is very active and dedicated in the discussion forums. I am afraid, I have to give this course 0 stars for content (for now) and 5 stars for course lead dedication. ",2

The discussions refers to code samples different from the ones available for download (flow2.js) and to applications present on the IBM Bluemix platform, without explaining where to found or how to create them. All these discrepancies make really difficult to follow the course. LBNL, the speaker is one of the most boring ever encountered in a webinar, barely able to read in english language.

7652,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Jesús A,"Jun 8, 2019","Excellent course content overall. However, the lack of practical exercises to actually apply what is covered in the lectures really decreases the course value. I would advise to make this an specialization with hands-on practice, since the range of topics the course includes is just too dense to effectively leave a solid, real-world applicable knowledge in 6 weeks. ",3
7653,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Kumar R,"Jul 27, 2019","The course is at introductory level and not intermediate. There is a good ""basic information"", but no hands-on exercise. That leaves a lot that actually needs to be learned upon the student. So, in my opinion, the course doesnt even consider the skill building at introductory level from an introductory standpoint.",2
7654,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,rustom s,"Apr 8, 2018",Very boring and no hands on content.,1
7655,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Zack D,"Jun 8, 2018","Overall good course. Rated as intermediate but more beginner in my opinion. Lots of overlap with what i would expect in an 'vanilla' data science course. If youve taken anything like that expect to hear alot of things you have heard before but does thuroughly extend in to the spatial aspect and application.
I would have perferred a little more emphasis on analysis techniques and deeper applications. I was also suprised by no direct application of for the student at all. all video based no hands on.
Last couple of quizes are also pretty tough, mostly from the fact that they are poorly written and difficult to answer from an infromed perspective.",3
7656,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Julia H,"Apr 18, 2020","A comprehensive overview of Spatial Analytics tools and processes which I was looking for.  However, the speaker's strong accent and sometimes incorrect use of English made learning difficult.  This could be a much better course with an updated, revised presentation and a different speaker.  ",2
7657,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Tino K,"Feb 3, 2021","I really want to believe that the lecturer has an in depth knowledge of the topic but as many others pointed out before: The course is providing no practical content at all and from an international academic researcher with multiple years working experience in native English speaking countries I would expect a clear and understandable communication. This was unfortunately not the case. It was very hard to follow the lectures that are ""purely read from the slides"". Quizzes became indeed hard because of a certain language barriers. Terminologies of teaching (e.g. ""In this course you learned [...]"" or ""In the past course you studied [...]"") are a bit misleading into the perception of an applicable understanding of the concepts. But knowledge does not equal understanding. To have ""studied"" or ""learned"" a topic one needs to get lectures that are didactically formulated well and maybe provide hands-on experience with the topic. At least giving a small assignment and trying around with QGIS would have provided some value.
I also agree with others that this course should be updated and rerecorded with a speaker that is more comfortable with spoken English. I'm sure Yonsei University can do this!",1
7658,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,CHESSEL P,"Jul 16, 2019","The course presents a good overview of Data Science techniques applied to Spatial Data topics. It is very compact and exhaustive. Mostly theorethical.
I think a second part of this course should be created with  in-depth coverage with practical exercises (e.g setting up a hadoop system with MapReduce, pig, Hive). 
This way, students could learn a lot more than by simply watching the videos offered. Further, please provide the well designed slides for download.",4
7659,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Gopinath P,"Sep 3, 2019",The course is way overloaded with way too many concepts.It should have clear prerequisites and defined educational background before taking.Some concepts are really vaguely described and pushed on.Can really improve on this.,3

7661,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,AMAN T,"Apr 7, 2020","Practical and hands-on exercises should be included to get a close feel of the subject. Only theoretical knowledge gets monotonous. Some topics were well touched upon however, some external resources like books or other courses related to subject would have been very helpful. The youtube links were helpful though. ",4
7662,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Michael B,"Jun 11, 2018","I learned about different spatial data science techniques, but didn't get a chance to try them out.

7663,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Javier F M S,"Jun 18, 2020","The theory was very interesting and you learn a lot about spatial data science, as well as something very basic about the proposed architecture.

7664,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Keith P C L,"Sep 15, 2020","The course was able to provide excellent theoretical foundations for spatial data science and its applications. However, some points required more explanation such as that of the spatial big data management system, as this required and asked for a deeper understanding from the student. Despite this, I still think that the course was able to provide ample instruction for spatial data science. Additionally, the course was substantial enough to incite interest for the student to delve deeper into the field. Lastly, there may be advanced solutions for data science in the present day but the course was right in presenting noble solutions and tools since the trustworthiness of the ""classics"" are unquestionable. ",5
7665,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Ahmed W M,"May 2, 2020",This course is excellent ! IT touches upon all the different topics related to spatial data science in a very straight to the point way. This is extremely beneficial for the spatial data scientist community. What I liked about this course is that it focused on data issues and concepts that I have always struggled with and never found an answer to in other GIS courses which mostly focus on their area of application. This one is generic and the concepts can literally be translated in any field. I think that hands-on exercises would have made it perfect especially in the fourth topic of spatial big data. I will be willing to take another course by this teacher especially if it has hands-on exercises.,5
7666,Spatial Data Science and Applications by Yonsei University,Gary C,"Mar 21, 2022","This is an excellent course that serves as a great introduction to spatial data science. The Instructor is obviously very knowledgable and is very enthusiastic.  The course introduces a lot of material veru quickly. My only suggestion to the Instructor would be to perhaps rethink the Week 6 quiz. IMO there was not enough material presented in the course for the learner to answer several questions. Having said that, I'm glad I took the course. It was fun and I learned a lot!",5

7777,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,QIHUA Z,"Jun 20, 2018","I have to be honest. This course was bad learning experience for me. Watching the videos was a waste of time. The instructor is just typing commands without properly explaining the context. All you learn from the videos is probably a list of names of the tools you can use and some of it's syntax, which really doesn't require hours of tedious videos. It may be more productive just to look at the name of the tool and go google by yourself. Watching the videos is like someone telling you HOW to use the tool (how to type the command), but didn't tell you WHAT the tool is doing, and WHY we want to use these tools. The HOW port is explained, but the WHAT and WHY parts? Sorry it's not there. What's funny is that, in the quiz they ask you WHATs and WHYs! At that time you would be thinking: ""yea, these are good questions! but they were never explained in the videos. Would have been nice if these knowledges were covered!"" That's the time when you go googling, hoping the get some answers to pass the quiz.",2
7778,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Jia Q,"Jun 1, 2021","It has been a struggle for me to take the course. I am in 2021, the virtual linux system the course provided is a bit out of date, it has taken me a lot of time to get it normally functioning. 
(WARNING for incoming friends: if you can't get the centos6 system they provided working, I would recommend not to take the course, because nearly all the quiz projects require the tools that were already installed in that system. I've tried to install them on my own system, but it was extremely hard to have them all, and requires extra knowledge in linux.)
I can feel the lecturer knows a lot, but she is not explaining things clearly. We need to use a lot of tools for different purposes and the output data is quite hard to interpret, but during the lessons, most of the time was wasted on typing the codes, without explanation. Also the English subtitles are terrible, there are a lot of errors, quite unfriendly for non-native speakers. 
But the good thing about this course is, it has covered the basic workflows for genome assembly and transcriptomics, at least it provides a guideline. But need a lot of extra work (even more than the lecture time) to google and read other instructions. The project quizzes are quite hard (not about the codings, it is still the problem of lacking explanation). After completing it, I took some time to summarize the whole workflow, and I found it quite helpful for understanding the whole process. 
Overall, this course teaches super cool things, but in a poorly organized manner. I didn't find any other course on coursera that could substitute this course. So just bear with it if you really want to learn linux commands for genomics. ",3
7779,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Jaydeep S,"Apr 30, 2018","This is a very poorly designed and executed course. The teacher should have used a bit more practical examples and the video lengths is too long. I have to leave it halfway, because I don't see any point of wasting my time with it. Its sad that this is part of such a great specialization module. I hope the user comments allow the course designers to implement some changes to this course. ",1
7780,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Jason M,"Nov 30, 2017","The worst class I've ever encountered in my life. The teacher mumbles to herself and the transcript often even says '[teacher mumbles]' at the critical point of the lecture. The majority of the class teaches useless and outdated material. Moreover, the quizzes reflect useless documentation details, as opposed to relevant content in genomics. To even do the quizzes, you're required to torrent their virtual machine image with an insecure checksum, thus compromising the security of your computer. The teacher herself clearly didn't read the documentation for the most basic Linux commands, hence she constantly uses inefficient commands, such as 'more' instead of 'less'. Altogether, this class is pathetic and will probably make you less competent in having wasted your time. Truly shameful. ",1
7781,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Paul S,"Aug 29, 2018","The instructor clearly knew her material. She tried to present it systematically with enough information to give students the ability to perform the programming tasks.  There were, however, a number of areas where there is substantial room for improvement. 
 1.  The slides were underutilized.  Listing a command name is not enough information to use it.  For the most part this was adequately done in the lectures, but having details on  critical implementation formats in slides would have been a helpful visual.  
 2.  The class was all about using command line instructions.  When the command line was shown on screen it was hard to read and frequently covered over by the video controls.  Moving it up and making it large enough to read would be very helpful. 
 3.  Although some details of the output file structure were presented a lot was left for the student to dig out of other sources.  If you don't know what to look for this makes things very difficult. 
 4.  The class is about using genomic analysis programs but the instructor did not provide information about where to download the appropriate files from.",4
7782,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,ELISA W,"May 25, 2018","This class really needs to be redone.  In fact, it would be more productive to work off of the tools with python and/or galaxy.  This class is essentially watching someone type and then trying to figure everything out on your own afterwards.  It is not productive to learning the material, and will not help any of the students.  I thought that the galaxy class was bad, but considering it is 4-star compared to this one!!  
Not only was teaching helpful tools not accomplished, but it required installation of the VM box which modified my registry!  I will not have to uninstall everything and return my Windows to a previous start point to undo the issues it is causing.  I am actually pretty angry that I had to take this class to get my certification.  seriously, replace it with something helpful!!  watching someone type (and tiny type at that) does not promote learning.

7783,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Marc B,"May 1, 2020","This was one of the worst courses I had on Coursera :( The content is more focused on learning command line arguments and how to use unix tools rather than on the rationale behind the tools and what the arguments are doing. Even worse, the content of the video lectures is often not sufficient to solve the quiz/exams. Either there is content that is neither mentioned nor referenced in the lecture or there is too much ambiguity in the instruction/question to deduct a clear answer.
The virtual machine image is not usable nowadays and with different versions of the tools you can't solve the exams. It was really a frustrating experience this course :(",1

The lectures give some idea the general pipelines in genomic analysis and show the usage of the most essential tools. However the Instructor sometimes uses commands that she does not explain and the data structure is completely elusive. The exams are badly designed and poorly explained. They take MUCH more time than expected. With a rudimental knowledge about the command line language I was able to finish the course but it was painful. I do give 3 stars cose I think I learned quite a bit during the course. As painful as it was at times. IMPORTANTLY, Instructor is absent from the forum and it seems she pretty much abandoned it.",3

One major issue is the lecture lacks sufficient descriptions why we do particular things, and the instructor's non-native English speaking and monotone worsen the situation such that I was often lost about the purpose of certain calculation. The second issue is that the course needs additional materials that aid students during the learning. The lecture video itself is not effective to provide sufficient guidance.

Much of the content I began using in my job (genomics biotechnology company) immediately - literally within 24 hours of learning.  It accelerated my ability to accomplish tasks by a huge amount.  I would give 5 stars just for the content, but I gave 3 because the exams are outdated and out of context.  In Week 3, some of the content on the exam was not discussed in the course, and the last exam in Week 4 had many red herrings.  You can figure out what you need to actually do by reading the Discussion Forum for Week 4, but the course material should be updated so that students don't waste their time on unneccessary activities.",3
7789,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Diana K,"Jul 6, 2022","Ok. Generally this course is worse compared with previous courses in specialization.  I could mention 3 big problems:
1) Files are not provided. We saw how instructor used different files in video, but we could not repeat all steps, because we just had not them. SPOILER (I found files only for 1 week in disccusion forum, many thanks for this guy who provided it)
2) Every tool is not explained properly. In all lections you will see how to use this tool. What is it? Why do we need this tool? You need to find this information by youself. :/
3) You probably will have problems with setting Centos6 if you will take this course. I've had a problem also. I saw that a lot of guys had the same problem in discussion forum five yers ago. They asked and nobody helped yet... 
So, to sum up I don't recommend to take this course and pay money for it . But If you want to complete the specialization probably you have no choice. ",2
7790,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Jorge M Z H,"Aug 21, 2022","I learned several useful things, but with much difficulty. In the first place, the instructor does not seem very motivated to teach the course, as if she were only doing a job to fulfill and not because of a vocation or because she really wants to. The slides are very non-explanatory and the instructor frequently does things or uses commands without explanation. The course does not have support material that directly helps learning. Also, I don't know advanced English, so I have to put subtitles, these subtitles usually go in a part where the instructor wrote the commands, so it was very difficult to understand what she was doing. So I not recommned the course, but if you want the Genomic Science certificate, you have no option. Anyway, the topics in the course are very important to start using tools for NGS analysis.",2
7791,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Anastasia R,"Jul 22, 2020","There was no feedback in the forum. The last exam has misleading notes which is there from the beginning of the course (at least 4 years), but it seems that nobody cares to help students and to rephrase instructions. So, students have to help themselves. If you want to have the feedback about the course - check comments on the exam 4. 
Exams require exact numbers which may slightly vary from version to version and from additional options which may be used (in the same way as it was shown during the lecture). Finally, it may take ages to people complete the exam even if the commands they use are correct. This does not help learning, however, consumes enormous amount of time. ",1

If the previous course gives me the faith to continue learning something in Coursera, this course must be the reason that let me leave the Coursera left.

There are endless boring lectures on file types but no real practice with them. If you arent running a unix machine (and even if you are) you will need to run a virtual linux box on your computer for this course, which is rather temperamental.

What I really missed were the toy files to play with at the same time the instructor gives the lecture. They were NOT included in the materials of the course. 
I really like Coursera and in my experience the couses are of outstanding quality, both the videos and the course material. Sadly this course simply doesn't meet the standards I was used to having with Coursera. ",3

At the other hand, the difficulty possed by this course made it satisfying.

7802,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Ash H,"Nov 27, 2019","Very good course. Easy to follow and loads of useful skills and info.
It starts with some guidance on general Unix navigation and then teaches the format and tools for a range of different types of genomic data. Finally it teaches you to use tools for alignment and transcriptomics. It packs a lot in but plenty of demos and there's a chat board where you can ask questions.
I already had some experience with command line tools before doing this course but found I learned loads. If you don't have any experience with Unix or with bioinformatics tools I think you will find the course doable and you will learn a lot of very useful skills but it will take you a bit longer. I don't think you need to take the earlier courses to find this one useful. (I didn't.)
For me it was also useful to improve the organisation of my work when I'm doing data handling.
The online setup is good - it comes with pre set target dates for when to complete each module but you can reset them / push them back if needed. The videos have written transcripts underneath, these are mostly good but are made automatically so they occasionally mis hear more technical vocabulary. You can take the tests as many times as you want but only 3x every 8 hours.",5
7803,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,minli x,"Jan 26, 2016","The course content is very solid. It focuses heavily on the tools and technique, and there lacks the concepts and biology behind those tools. But I would guess there is some prior courses in this specialization explaining the concepts, though I didn't take them.
The tools explained in this course is the most popular ones for handling up-stream analysis. They are the must-have ones for current bioinformatician jobs.
The instructor, Dr Liliana Florea, did a great job, walking you through those tools step-by-step. I also found the exercises (exams) highly useful.
The course title is not the most accurate one. The title is not very catchy either. This course is more about the tools for analyzing next generation sequence data.",5
7804,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Tran N,"Feb 26, 2019","It was a quite challenging experience, especially the final module. The problem you have to deal with is not ""how to properly use the programs/tools"", instead, we have to learn ""how to play with the parameters"" so that we can have the right answers for the quiz/exam questions. There were a lot of failures throughout this course, I had to watch the lectures again and again, deeply dive into the discussions in course forum, search google and seqsanswer/biostar forum, etc.... I became hating the lecturer and the mentors for theirs not so well organized lectures and answers ... But afterall, I've learned a lot. Thank you!",5

Taking this course was a pure enjoyment. I have learned so much about the use of command line tools in Genomics. Why they are used, how they are used and what are the most popular tools. This course offers a real good overview of the field in general. 
The tools of the last week are outdated by now but for me, the whole take-away of that week was learning about the workflow of an RNA-seq  analysis and its importance.

7856,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Nate R,"Oct 31, 2016","Coming in as a veteran coder of 2 decades, I thought this would be ""easy"". And, had I completed it using my own C/Python code, it probably would have. However I made the decision to stick with ONLY the command line tools and actually ended up learning a lot more about basic unix tools that I rarely get to use. 
Be prepared to knuckle down and REALLY learn a lot about the specific commands and what they provide as there are a ton of them. The instructor goes into a ton of detail on each one and the course is laid out in a nice flow starting with the basics and ending with a very challenging exam at the end that showcases an entire RNA-seq technique. 
With a bit more polish, it would be 5 stars, but as it stands there is a bit rough around the edges.
I think this course should be #2 in the specialization as the underlying concepts of RNA-seq and how the tools fit together would have been invaluable while taking the current #2 course on Galaxy. I think that I can now go back and get 100% on the final project armed with the RNA-seq techniques that were not originally covered in my first run through the Galaxy content. ",4
7857,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Deepti R,"Nov 6, 2017","Excellent quizzes and exams. Smooth flow of lectures. However, as a beginner I faced a lot of difficulty in installing the required tools. I could complete the course only because the tools were provided as a package with the VM box. I will be handling NGS data for my PhD project, for which I will have to install the latest versions of these tools. Manuals are cryptic. A lot of errors keep cropping up whenever I try to install anything. This course should have taught us that part too.

7887,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,DBel,"Jun 7, 2023","I feel like this course started off well with an insightful introduction to UNIX, but then missed the chance to reach its full potential. While the introduction to SAM, BED, GTF, VCF  etc. formats is very helpful, tools like bowtie2 and tophat are already outdated. Some important aspects were explained in only a few seconds, while quite some time was spent on correcting the commands (the usage of shortcut keys to navigate the command line might have been helpful). The lectures very therefore quite tedious. 
If you are new to the topic, it might be pretty confusing and, personally, I was prone to mix up many of the tools, like samtools, bedtools, bcftools, that have very similar names and perform somewhat related operations. It would have been very helpful from a didactic point of view to provide a few overview slides that structure all the relevant tools and their commands and group them into application fields . This would make it easier for the learner to grasp their interrelationships. 
All in all, a helpful, but not ideal, course for anyone who is interested to learn more about the practical aspects of analyzing and aligning NGS data to the genome.",3
7888,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Kasper T K,"Nov 21, 2017","Great course, the instructor does a great job in introducing the students to some off the important sequencing analysis tools. Some of the lectures are although a bit bland, where the instructor reads the entire contents of a slide for format files or program options, this is sometimes quite useless as you can read that yourself by... simply reading the slides.
Forums were not always very useful, sometimes solving error messages were supported by referring to the manual page, instead of actually bothering to look through the code for providing more constructive feedback on what goes wrong in a given example.
Instead, examples should be given which elaborates on the effects on chosen different parameters - like ""If you want to make a local alignment, use the bla.bla option. However, beware that when using this, more errors are prone to be assigned...bla.bla."".
For the format, interesting columns in the format files in general are interesting, when looking for e.g. ""amount of unique genes"" etc.
By doing this, we would be helped better into understanding questions of the quizzes, while also delivering an even deeper understanding of the formats and tools.",3
7889,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Onur S,"Feb 20, 2018","I really struggled to complete this course. The extent of coverage of the topics is quite good, however this is a applied course and application part is lacking A LOT. The biggest drawback here is that the instructors demonstrations are not accessible to learners. This limits the learning experience so much that you get stuck even at the easiest question in a module exam. Some questions in the exams really require the learner to think and do google searches to figure out a strategy to answer the question (this is a good thing, though). However, it can be very easy to get bogged down and lose focus while figuring out what's going wrong.  It is advised to visit discussion forums before taking module exams. I think you should not expect to master the presented tools after finishing the course, but you will still get a decent understanding of them",3
7890,Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Emil C F,"Feb 4, 2020","Great inclusion in the specialization. I never knew anything about shell until now and I feel like I can use a lot of things from the course in my day-to-day data treatment/processing tasks. I am only giving 3 stars because I spend about 40-50% of the time troubleshooting technical things. The CentOS Vmbox is a great idea but that hardly worked for me (it interfaced weird with OSX and I could get it to understand my keyboard layout, shared folders did not work either) and was a source of frustration. One suggestion for the course would be to help the student verify the initial data set before completing all the analyses on it ... e.g. in the reading section mention the length of the output or similar. Twice I filled out an entire exam ""correctly"" but had the wrong initial output. You don't learn a lot from that but it does take a long time. ",3

Most of the tools used are already deprecated (TopHat, Cufflinks) but you still need them to pass the exams. Finally, there is no interaction in the forum and no answer to the messages, so you will have zero help from the staff. If you need to earn a course certificate, do not take the course.

7907,SQL for Data Science with R by IBM,Milcah M J,"Jul 12, 2021","The course was well-structured, informative and easy to follow. One suggestion for improvement I have is that a cheat-sheet or catalogue of sorts be provided within the course, which collates all the coding and syntax from the course onto one single space.
This is especially helpful while taking up the course as part of the specialization series. It isn't easy to remember precise code syntax after just one or two uses of a function. As I progressed through the courses in the specialization, I found myself having to return to previous courses and comb through the hands-on labs to retrieve specific codes, functions and syntaxes. This was time-consuming and wasteful, and can easily be remedied by a list of codes (with syntax) used in an entire course.
Apart from that, great effort by the team, and a big thank you to the creators, developers, moderators and testers!",4

Then, at the end, they put a practice lab in which you have to wrap up everything which you have learned, evidently, given the fact that this is a lot of things, you have forgotten things already. Also, there are some things that they never explain, for example the command sqlSave was never mentioned in the videos, and appears randomly at the lab. In the end, you can learn a lot of things with this course, but from week 4 and forward you will have to put a big autonomous effort to understand things correctly.

I spent much more time trying to figure out how to get through the different environments, than learning and practising SQL. Given that I don't need any more degrees, it would have been - in hindsight - much more productive to read a book on SQL and complement it through discussions with a ChatBot.

7940,"SQL for Data Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Noah M,"May 10, 2020","It was Ok. It's largely down to you to get the project done to the highest standard you can muster... if you're stuck just use stackoverflow. But through that I learned a hell of a lot, just stick to your ambition with answering your question and plug away at trying to get the answer even if it means googling lots to work lots of stuff out yourself. If you do, you may have a project worthy of being shared with your network or even blogged about.
Some feedback: given this was part of a SQL specialization, it would've been interesting to ensure candidates created a database that they would query themselves, rather than just draw the ER diagram. But to be fair on Course 4, that wasn't taught in the courses before, just seems to me to be an opportunity missed?
Another feedback: it may have been more helpful for the examples to be based in Spark / Pyspark for them to have the feel they build on Course 3 of this Specialization. Again, a missed opportunity if people just reverted to Pandas and not use the Capstone to apply Course 3 teachings.
But as always and perhaps rightly it's up to the learner to construct their project in a way that's meaningful to their learning goals.
Thanks for the course",3
7941,"SQL for Data Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Fabian E P C,"Sep 13, 2022","This is the worst specialization I have taken so far on Coursera, and I have taken several, either from universities or private companies.
 The first course is fine for someone who already has SQL knowledge and just needs a refresher, but it is still a course with zero depth in the use of SQL in data science. It is just slides, better explanations of SQL can be found on YouTube.
The second course shows an interesting use of SQL, which is not normally covered. But the structure, assessments, assignments and final project are very open and ambiguous. The explanations are superfluous and you can tell that the course was made in a hurry, with no attention to details and with deficiencies in teaching.
Perhaps the third course is the best, as they present a useful technology and platform.
The final project is a total disappointment, as it is not focused on SQL and its use in Data Science activities, the videos are largely a recycling of those seen in previous courses, so that SQL, which is what the specialization is about, you do not learn something new or have the opportunity to apply it as it really applies in Data Science. Better SQL projects are found on YouTube, but these do not give a certificate endorsed by an educational institution such as the University of California, Davis. Sad that the readings in week four are links to other courses, they did not bother to create material or even reference it in a better way.
 Zero material is shared. 
After this experience I think I will not take any other course or specialization of this University, as well as not recommend it, I finished it just to receive the certificate, but I think it is not worth spending time on it.",2
7942,"SQL for Data Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Jannis,"May 11, 2022","This course was mainly a Python-course instead of an SQL-course - not only in terms of examples and screencasts, but also the exercises can not be sufficiently worked through with SQL solely. If no pyhton / R / scala and visualization skills are already there, it would take far to much time to learn it in such a small course. Additionally, the exercises did not point out all the nessecairy aspect to fulfill to get the full score clearly in all cases: When they say ""use 1 or 2 new metric"" they actually mean: ""Set up 2 metrics to get the full score"", which is odd, because one might instead focus on other aspect on the analysis, when following the first formulation.

Again (as in the 2nd course of the specialization) I did not find it fruitful to dive deep into a dummy dataset, that has nothing to do with our actual profession. Additionally, this is far from being presentable in a portfolio. I would suggest providing a specialization filled with the basics and techniques, leave the application up to the real use cases. This is not effectively teachable in a MOOC. 

Additionally, pointing out to paid courses from the same provider, as had been done in week 4, is not providing resources, it is advertising.

I also disliked the fact that all assignments were peer graded. That slowed down progression dramatically and I do not benefit from unqualified feedback from people who are no more capable or even less capable than I am. Also the reviews often where simply wrong.

If a course where skills from the previouse ones are being united - which btw. this course not really resembles of - is really needed - which I doubt - then I would suggest presenting more best practices and techniques of structuring data and a project and questioning these knowledge in quizzes.",2
7943,"SQL for Data Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Hong B,"Sep 14, 2020","I think the aim for the course encourage exploration using the learned skill. Which is fine, actually a great idea. But the execution is sloppy. I think the course need to be balanced between exploration and steering as well. It should be designed so that some insights was hidden in the data and with no particular instruction, the students should find out these insights. So they have meaningful goal that they reached as well as a handful of exploration experience from the lack of instruction.
Instead? We have 3 sets of data, which are too narrow even compare to the example given in the lecture. Also the lecture and the assignments are barely comparable, which is more confusing. The peer review is cute and all but not too useful in this kind of capstone project where learners are generally inexperience.
Overall, not too much value was added from the course unless you want to experience the frustration of working with data, which you can get elsewhere. Not recommended",2

- Real life-like scenario for you to study by yourself and come to your own conclusions and analysis.
Cons:
- Some knowledge of Python is required even tho this is a SQL specialization targeted at beginners with little-to-no prior programming knowledge of any kind. You shouldn't have to go to something like stackoverflow to troubleshoot things that weren't even discussed in this or prior courses since it more or less defeats the purpose of enrolling in guided courses like this one.
- 4 peer-graded assignments. In my opinion, this is the weakest link in all of Coursera. Especially when it comes to courses targeted at beginners. You really can't expect a beginner to rate some of these, more nuanced projects correctly/fairly simply by giving them a cheat sheet. That's without mentioning language barriers and peer availability (this course is the least enrolled of the specialization, btw), among other things.
Overall, it's kinda disappointing to see a specialization that started so well end (for those lucky enough to get graded) up in such a mediocre fashion. I won't be taking any more courses by UC Davis nor recommending them after I'm done with this one.",1

However I found some of the labs to be lacking in quality (some question unclear, some which I struggled due to some subtelty within only to realize that the solution proposed did not answer the question, repetition of the same structure and questions for each new regression method but no in depth commentary about the comparison of the score which would be helpfull to understand how one would choose one or another in real life).
The final Project is also clearly ML oriented even if some basic data analysis can answer the topic without the need of any of the methods discussed in the course. This leads to kind of over-engineer a solution with ML, which is not a good real life practice. A dataset where ML would have been mandatory to meet the requirement would have been more adequate.

8013,Statistics for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Paul S,"Jan 3, 2018","The worst executed course I have taken in 36 years of post-graduate education.
1  The instructor speaks so fast it is difficult even for a native English speaker like myself to understand.
2.  This course is only suitable as a review for people who are experts in the field already.  Even if you know how to use Bioconductor and are familiar with programming in R, if you don't know the tools being used already the instruction in the course will not give enough information to be able to do the quizzes without a great deal of difficulty. 
3.  The examples presented are thrown out in a cursory fashion without enough detail about how the data is being set up or manipulated.  Matrices are transformed and recombined with little explanation about why things are being done. 
4.  Although generalizing from material presented to new applications is a valid instructional approach, the instruction does not give the student enough information to do this and the instructor expects students to be able to figure out new algorithms from vague public domain documentation. 
5.  Although the instructor makes an impassioned plea for carefully thought out statistical test design, proper documentation of work flow, and appropriate use of p-values, he does not describe the interpretation of statistical tools presented.  For example, tools for calculating thousands of principle components in seconds is given, but beyond showing clusters of dots on a graph may indicate a genetic cluster does not explain what the individual points in the PCA mean.

I liked how the professor recommended some extra reading at the end of every topic. I also really liked the fact that he recommended some extra courses to be taken. 
But despite that, the course itself was a bit too short - the topics introduced just scratched the surface. This made sitting through the R tutorials particularly tedious - how would one get the use of R tools to do the tasks, if they haven't understood the theory properly? I know it's supposed to be an intro course, but still in its current state it can be a bit confusing. I would suggest making it somewhat longer, so that the intro to each topic could be done a bit more in depth - maybe focusing a bit more on the theory, so that the students could get an intuition for the methods, rather than just doing R commands which for them mean nothing if the theory is still very blurry.",3

The ways of illustration on many definitions are unprofessional and shallow, so it sounds confusing at least for me, who majored in public health and has some experience in this field.

This course could improve dramatically by extending it a couple of weeks and covering some of the material in greater depth.

8053,Statistics for Genomic Data Science by Johns Hopkins University,Charles W,"Jan 3, 2021","I thought this course covered a good set of relatively well-organized material.
I think some of the quiz questions (and optional analysis) was a little buggy in Week 1 (where I needed to use different versions of R for different questions), and I am not sure if that is because some time has passed since the course was first created.  There were also issues for some of the questions in the other weeks, but I don’t remember being as frustrated when figuring out how to get an answer that was counted as correct (or, more specifically, not being able to run the intended code).
Additionally, I think this course will probably take more time to complete than listed in the syllabus.  I support needing to take more time to learn the material, but I think the estimates can be kind of important when deciding if there is enough time to take the course (for somebody who already has a full time job).
There was also at least one section in Week1 that I thought was more of an opinion.  For example, there are important and popular programs for genomic analysis that are *not* available through Bioconductor (including some mentioned in Week 4), and I don’t think they are less “trustworthy.”  However, I agree that listing resources and explaining the differences is important.
I think I mentioned it in another course review, but I think the limitations to the methods are something to consider.  So, I agree that p-hacking can be a problem, but I think telling people that they should only analyze their data once can also cause problems.  I also agree with sharing a public log, even if the problems/bugs that are fixed are not emphasized as much in an official report/problem (as findings that should be given weight in the conclusions, if you found reason why they were wrong).
I noticed that there was a moderator responding to forum questions, so that was nice.
I imagine that I might participate a bit more, even though I have formally completed the course.

8075,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Marcio G,"Aug 21, 2017","The whole specialization is a bit of a mixed bag... Many of the courses rely too heavily on teaching R programming and not sufficiently on data science concepts (such statistics or machine learning). The instructors (specially Peng) spent way too much time detailing R syntax that could have been picked up by the students on their own from other resources available on the web...
The regression models and statistical inference courses are exceptions though: Together with the machine learning course, these are probably the most useful from the whole specialization.
The materials in this capstone project are way sloppier than materials in other courses by the way. They lack structure and feel confusing. I'm not even sure if the instructors tried to implement the proposed project themselves to have a base of reference.  Feels like they were already growing tired of the whole thing and put the capstone project together in a hurry without much thought or care.
The theme of the project is indeed interesting (text-mining and NLP), but I think that would have been more productive for me to take a NLP course instead. You are going to use very little from what you have learned from the other courses in the specialization (for the most part the data product course) and you will need to learn text-mining and NLP from scratch on your own to complete the capstone (no videos nor materials available in the course on these subjects).
Also, if I was going to implement the same app on my own these days, I would probably use RNNs, not Katz Back-off and Markov Transition Matrices as in the capstone and I would probably use SparkR. Heck, I might not even use R, probably Scala or Python with Spark instead. In short, data science moves fast and this course already feels very outdated...
The instructors seem quite experienced in statistical analysis, so it's a shame that they decided to focus so heavily on R programming instead... That would have made the specialization more resilient to technological innovations in the field...
The specialization surely could be improved and these issues corrected, but all courses seem pretty much abandoned by the instructors. Most of the courses still have active ""mentors"" (volunteers not associated with Coursera nor Johns Hopkins) , but ""mentors"" seem to have lost contact with the instructors: For example, a couple of assignments require data that is no longer available (dead links) and ""mentors"" have provided this data in the discussion fora. I reckon that if ""mentors"" could contact instructors, the dead links would have been fixed in the materials by now...
The peer-grading doesn't work so well... Most of the submissions I graded were painful to review (extremely low quality). Not surprisingly, the graders were also pretty low-skilled. They can't even understand the requirements (and I suspect not even the English language) and they will take points from correct submissions.
 I urge any employers to look at the actual code for this capstone from candidates given the general incompetence and poor skills of the students I graded. The grading criteria is pretty relaxed, so even though I would like to fail them, I still had to give them a passing grade. Such a weak grading criteria is detrimental to all people who actually have the skills and put hard work on their submissions. Many undeserving people will, unfortunately, pass and receive a certificate.",1
8076,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Thej,"Aug 1, 2019","I spent 80 hrs on this course. I hated so many things. 1. There was lot of uncertainty in the course.

Saviours were those few people who put up help posts on the forum and sharded thier trecherous experience going down different paths. 3. The topic was already hard enough NLP, something I had no clue about and then there was this additional problem all the fucing time about memory. Jesus!

8077,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Roberto G,"Dec 3, 2017","This class is challenging and a lot of people complained so I'll tell you my approach since I was able to complete it on the first try in my free time from my full time job. Not having any knowledge of Natural Language Programming, I found Youtube videos and presentations from the Stanford class taught by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning. Study it up to the explanation of n-grams, it should be enough for the class.  I completed the first weeks in few days so I had more time to actually build the model and the app (you'll need more than the scheduled weeks if you have no prior experience). I found valuable resources in the course forum. Then you're pretty much on your own, identify the best packages, how to use them, look on Stack Overflow when you get stuck. Start using a very small set of data so you can quickly build the model and the app until you get something that works. After that you can improve the model by using more data, finding the balance between processing time, app  time response and prediction accuracy. Everyone understands the limitation of the project so give importance to quickness rather than accuracy.
My overall evaluation of the project is a mixed bag. The positive is that it introduces you to a new topic (NLP) and the goal is reasonable, it takes a lot of effort but it's not impossible and it forces you to learn something meaningful (something easier would have not made me learn something valuable). The negative is that there is no explanation whatsoever about NLP, which was never mentioned in the previous courses, so there's not much teaching or guidance. The involvement of Swiftkey is limited to providing the data.",4
8078,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Paul R,"Mar 22, 2019","The project topic itself is interesting, but longer (structured as 7 weeks); not much guidance until you find the right threads from mentors in the discussion forum from a few years ago or repeatedly google stackoverflow; it is much more technical than the rest of the course; and doesn't really use much of what was learned during the meat of the specialization's statistics/regression/ML courses, other than data science principles and tools (though new R libraries were needed).  These issues aside, the project was an interesting challenge to complete nonetheless.  Overall this specialization is now a few years old, and the plethora of 4 and 5 star reviews across all courses seem generous and out-dated.  Materials are not being updated, forums are a mess of years-old threads with not much current activity; there is a feeling of waning interest and participation. This was clearly cutting edge material and course back in 2014-6, if JH/Coursera intend to continue offering it, the material needs some refresh and reordering, tougher grading rubrics (I saw a lot of inconsistency and poor quality which met the rubric criteria, alongside great quality work), and more active involvement from lecturers and mentors (and, please fix the typos).",3
8079,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Jose A V C,"Apr 16, 2016","Very disappointed with this final course. Little to no support. Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own.
Very challenging to come up to speed with Natural Language Processing techniques if you have never taken any class about it.
My recommendation to JHU and Coursera is to add a separate course for NLP where you cover all the basics and then have the Capstone.",2
8080,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Tony W,"Mar 21, 2017","In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research. The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one). 
I do not recommend this course or the specialization.",1
8081,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,E. C,"Feb 18, 2017",NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself.

8082,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Piyush V,"Mar 26, 2018","On the Capstone Course, those who are reading this review I would say, skip everything (videos) and directly start writing codes and building the app. Otherwise this course is somewhat unnecessarily stretched too much, it could have been cut way short. I will tell you what I did: I skipped everything, got the gist of the objective, scanned through the codes and worked on my idea. 
  I started the specialization in December of 2015 and I am ending it today, March of 2018. I remember struggling with R in the beginning (I was a novice programmer writing dirty codes). Now I can't stop thinking about plethora of data product opportunities surrounding me.   ",4
8083,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,N T,"Mar 5, 2018",Capstone did provide a true test of Data Analytics skills. Its like a being left alone in a jungle to survive for  a month. Either you succumb to nature or come out alive with a smile and confidence.,5
8084,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Fulvio B,"Dec 4, 2020","It is nice when you arrive at the end of the specialization and I understand that being this the final step of the specialization that has to demonstrate that you are able to put together more or less all the things you were presented during the journey you have to be left a bit alone. However I think this capstone is now outdated. It does not mentioning new packages that are now available and performing very well (e.g. tidytext) and also some of the references mentioned in the ""lessons"" are not available anymore at the url given. I think at least these should be maintained.",3
8085,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Marcos d S M,"Feb 28, 2022","In data science, two of the best specializations taught by the Coursera platform are from The JHU and IBM. There are many comparative assessments to choose which would be the best choice according to the profile of the postulant. It's probably worth doing both. In any case, I ratify jhu's data science expertise, in the sense that it is quite rich, deepens very little explored topics in regular undergraduate courses, and is directed specifically to statistics and big data. It assumes that the student has a good basis of mathematics and statistics of higher level and good knowledge base in R. I say only good base, because the R is quite vast, and the specific classes of programming in R are sequenced, practically from scratch, but of well accelerated progression. In some more specific topics, I had to complement the knowledge with very objective and punctual parallel courses, such as the themes of the DataCamp platform, which serves well to unlock some punctual subject. StackOverFlow's help and feedback alsocomes as a great help at all levels of learning, including professor Roger Peng's first lesson: knowing how and where to seek help to move forward, that is, the first major lesson in data science is the humility of being an astronaut in a virtually infinite universe,and expanding every day. This is the most fascinating of Data Science, Biostatistics and R: the themes never run out and become concatenated in the face of the phenomena that surround us daily. From there, the sequence of 10 courses represents a long way (not so long for some) of development, feedbacks, evaluations and model building in R. Undoubtedly an excellent specialization, which is worth the investment, especially time. The final part of the specialization represents the last steps, but the steepest of the journey. In the latter, in particular, metaphorically you are confronted with yourself, a feeling of having been blindfolded in the middle of a dense dark forest, and now need to find your way back using what you have learned so far. For all specialization graduates it is a stage of relief, rather than celebration. The percentage of evasion of specialization from the first course is very large. In a master's and doctorate, I believe it is a specialization of great support, for the publication of studies and analysis of field data, in order to reach assertive conclusions from hypothesis tests. Upon completion of the specialization, JHU encourages the publication of the Certificate of Completion on LinkedIn and, with this, you receive an invitation from Professor Brian Caffo, after a brief verification of authenticity (around 1 week), to join a private Data Science group moderated by him, where there are excellent networking opportunities with other scientists,partnerships, job opportunities and project development.

8086,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Carlos S,"Nov 19, 2019","I took this specialization a couple of months ago and did not comment as such. Now I turned around to remember some topics and started reading comments. 
 I found many comments that say the final project has nothing to do with the previous 9 courses and when I did it I thought the same. 
 Looking at it in perspective, I think the previous courses are absolutely necessary for the final project. The objective of carrying out a project with such characteristics is to apply the knowledge by oneself. 
 The first courses of programming in R, extraction and cleaning, and exploratory analysis are fundamental to understand the problem. In this case the cleaning has to do with the transformations using regular expressions and tokenization. The exploratory analysis should be done in any data science project, otherwise you may encounter surprises when implementing the models. 
 Statistical inference was necessary and closely linked to exploratory analysis, especially to select samples well and review distributions, since some machine learning methods may be affected by distributions. I must say that I did not see this when I took this course, but it was because of my lack of experience. Maybe there was a lack of guidance. 
 The algorithm I used was regression on the ngrams for simplicity, time and capacity of my computer, but it could have been combined with other methods such as neural networks or svm. 
 Implementing the model in shiny and then adjusting it because it was very heavy was also interesting. 
 As a summary, I really liked this specialization and although it was very hard and many times I did not know how to move forward (especially in the capstone), I think the challenge was important for my learning and I was very entertained.",5
8087,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Jesse S,"Apr 29, 2016",Coursera lost my thoughtful 2-star review so I am replacing it with this.

8088,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Ken W,"Nov 16, 2020","To tell you the truth, when I started this capstone, I felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the pool.  You are asked to build a NLP app using Shiny and, unfortunately, most, if not all, of the concepts required to design and build the app are not covered in the earlier courses in the specialization.  Can you say 'Google'?  I would have liked to have seen the instructors walk through the relevant concepts required to successfully complete this project.  The videos consist of Dr. Peng basically saying ""Good luck!""...a little lame if you ask me.",2

I have taken several courses related to data science; however, this specialization has set the quality in such high standard that I feel dissapointed with most of the courses around the web. 
I'm a technical guy who has most of his professional experience in academy, I know the process of creating new courses, of summarizing complex topics into understandable concepts but the most important is to show the application of the kwoledge into real world projects. Yes, all of this what is what I got from these courses.
Does the specialization worth?. Abosolutely yes!, the amount of knowledge that you would get is huge!. As everything in life, it will depend on how much effort you invest on it, there's a big part of the specialization that depends on you and if you are thinking on becoming a Data Scientist, you better get used to spend lots of time on doing your own research.
Finally, I just wanna let you know that I have started my career as a data scientist and I had several interviews with many companies/clients that were amazed by the quality of my portafolio that I built using all the final projects of this specialization.
I'm really greatfull with all the people involved in creating this specialization and I will absolutely recommend  this to anyone who is decided to become a data scientist.

But this is extremely rewarding. Doing is good job is possible (well, my grade is still pending at the time of this comment!) and makes students take a huge leap forward in data exploration, data cleaning, setting up a strategy for analysis and algorithm, make an Rpresentation, create an online app (by the way, I also created an small app for my company thanks to this training, especially the ""Developing Data Product"" course).",5

I think it would be great improvement if there was a additional 'post-grad' 'course'-like few weeks to connect to industry that is hiring from this background and get those connections to lead the 'grads' into real job interviews; Also, more projects that are direct connection to the industry, like the capstone - where those project would be dine perhaps in some kind of cooperation with the industry reps, so that graduate student here has direct path and had already worked with people that might hire him/her, where the time spent working on the capstone project includes meeting with the reps from the industry whom would have interest in the work.  Something along the lines of grants for university projects (not talking about money here) but of a connection to the needs of the industry. Students working on that if they deliver good and interesting results would have one foot into the new job. This would also allow for higher fees to be charged for the classes since there would be more tangible 'selling' path.",5
8101,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Fiona E Y,"Sep 29, 2016","This course is unlike all the others.  Although you will need information gained in the previous nine modules, the Capstone Project requires you to work on a long and difficult problem using your own initiative.  Mentors, tutors and Swiftkey employees are lacking throughout this project.
I worked through many different R packages to generate the word prediction N-Grams because R has a tendency to run out of memory.  Many students are forced to use a cut down version of the three million lines of text because of memory issues but I managed to find the proverbially needle in the R packages haystack that allowed me to use  the entire dataset!
I had problems 
with publishing the presentation to RPubs - it just would not work using either RStudio or RConsole but at least I had a fall back position of placing the presentation on my own website.
It took me three attempts to complete this project, nine months (Jan-Sep 2016) and about 300 hours in total, I didn't give up so nor should you, you can do it!  And Good Luck! Hope to chat with you on the Data Science Specialism LinkedIn Group for Completers!

Now we are asked to explore it almost solely by ourselves, which usually isn't the case at work, where one would seldom have to research on or develop something from scratch. Also I hope it will focus more on data analysis and visualization than developing an actual app. Shiny is a good tool to do interactive plotting, but not handy enough for UI development. I believe most people will never be asked to develop UI in Shiny at work. Finally I'd like to thank all the instructors who designed and delivered these 10 Data Science courses.

8115,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Richard I C,"Jul 19, 2016","As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""
There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.  
On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).
On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).
Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience.  I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.
With that, I am giving it three (3) stars.  As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete.  This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",3
8116,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Guilherme B D J,"Mar 24, 2017","The main reason for my rating is because the course is so ""loose"" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.
Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks. Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.
Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought. When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period. Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.
Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date. I know that this is exactly what will happen in the ""real"" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.
All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.
I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of ""noise"" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.",3
8117,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Don M,"Sep 21, 2019","A capstone is typically defined as integrating key material from a course. This capstone did not require material from key courses, specifically the machine learning, regression models, and statistical inference courses. That was a great shame. Instead, it threw us into a completely new area, Natural Language Processing. 
There were many complaints about that, and I agree. However, it was
 a  challenging task to explore an area in data science we didn't touch 
on, and challenging in terms of the 
programming and enormous data file sizes. In that sense it was probably 
good prep for unexpected challenges in the workplace and therefore good 
training to make us real data scientists. Still, I would like to see the capstone rejigged to include material from the missing courses.  As for NLP, some students claim it is not a useful area to study, but in my case it is exactly the right thing for me to study as I work with analyzing user queries in the form of tickets in a CRM. I found it especially trying to try to integrate some material such as Kneser-Ney theory and opted for a more basic approach. My learning experience would have been better with some proper instruction in that area. ",3

The first two tasks are really easy. The third one (creating a model) is ridiculous. It's nothing like the models we built in the modeling course. The number of people who have given up at that point and dropped is absurdly high.  I spent a month and a half trying to get enough background to get a working model up and running and eventually just decided it's not worth it for just a Coursera certificate. No offense, but this is more like a final project for a master's degree.
I understand that the idea is to push people to be able to deal with different kinds of data, but you give us all the tools we need for a specific kind of data and then drop a completely different kind of data from a completely different field, and NONE of the modeling techniques or even the stats actually apply to this new type of data.",1

Of course the topic NLP and word prediction is interesting, but the problem is, that this is a dead course. A couple of students in the forum strugeling with details, but there is NO Mentor, no Professor or other course staff and no SwiftKey engineer as announced in the Project Overview.
So everything you have to figure out completely by yourself and this takes a lot of more time than the 4-9 hours. And also why should you pay for a course where you learn anyway only ba your own.

8124,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Mike B,"May 7, 2022",I wish the course trained you to do anything with the capstone. Unfortunately the course teaches you how to build a bike and then the capstone asks for you to build a car. ,1
8125,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Jen Z W,"May 13, 2016","I had no experience in natural language processing before I took this course, and now I'm kind of in love with it! Some of my fellow learners complained about the new data type and little information provided, but I feel this is a good simulation of real world experience as a data scientist! The field is constantly changing, so we have to be ready to cope with unfamiliar problems and come up with creative solutions. Due to other commitments, I was once 3 weeks behind the weekly deadlines, but finally poured all my efforts into this and deployed an App in time... You never know how much you can accomplish before you are forced to do a ""Mission Impossible"" ;-)  I think I've improved my hacking + googling skills, and built more confidence over completion of this course. Thank you, JHU and Coursera!",5
8126,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Lucas T,"Jun 28, 2020","The idea of the final project is superb! It really pushes you to your limit, but giving resources through the way so you don't get lost, which is certainly pretty easy.
This course differs a lot from the previous ones because you are pretty much on your own, with only guidelines and references on what they suggest you should do.
The intention is clearly to mimic real life projects, where you have a basic goal, your and others expectations, and knowledge PLUS hardware limitations. And you will have to overcome it in order to be a good Data Scientist! 
I really recommend this specialization!",5
8127,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,P. C S,"Jan 12, 2024","Each Course has its own challenges.  The first few courses were easy to work through while the last three were more challenging, especially the Capstone.  Sometimes I had to go back to some of the earlier Courses to get refreshed on the material then continuing working on the Capstone Course.  All in all an enjoyable but challenging program.  I enjoyed every bit of it.  It pushed me to the limit.  I would encourage anyone to complete the whole program.",5
8128,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,tanish s,"Apr 7, 2022","This is, hands down, the best course in R that takes you from being a beginner to an inquisitive data scientist. Imparting knowledge about all that's possible with R programming language, everything about stastical learning and of course a really great experience of what being a Data Scientist is like. I'm really thankful to the JHU professors, namely, Brian Caffo, Roger Peng and Jeff Leek for making this all possible. Really awesome!",5
8129,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,RR A I,"Oct 24, 2020","This specialization was like a box of chocolate.  I at first thought it was easy, then found the difficulties and struggled a bit. Then again I urged myself to finish this slowly which was a good decision ultimately. At present, I am now relating the things I learnt with my study in the field of Economics. Thank you very much for organizing this specialization. This has been a great experience for me.

8131,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Subhadeep S,"Aug 3, 2021",The Practical assignments that i did through out the course is helpful. This course helps in establishing good foundation in the field of data science/analytics. One capstone for this vast field may not be enough and learners may need to follow more guided projects to get a better insight of what industry wants. ,5
8132,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Eric R,"Apr 4, 2017","For me this project was harder than all other courses combined but, because of that, also more rewarding! The theory is very scarce so you're on your own, that's what makes it hard. Once you get the theory right the rest is easy. I learned a lot of NLP and let me practice ""Pitchs"" using diferent R tools.",5
8133,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Desiré D W,"Sep 25, 2016","The Capstone starts well with sufficient guidance.

8136,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Lucas,"Aug 24, 2018",In this last module I have learned a lot. It was demanding and quite tricky as you were asked to take your own decisions as there is no best answer at all. I learned to decide what I want and to create an appropriate solution. The best lesson so far along this specialization track.,5
8137,Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University,Nirav D,"Jul 3, 2016","I loved doing the capstone project for the Data Science specialisation.

Laura the Tutor is so amazing and its very easy to follow her.
the only thing about this course content that i wish for was that if the SQL programming language part could be taught more. i had to use another platform to learn more about it. that is how i was able to finish most of assessment 3 and 4. but in all it is a great course and has opened up so many opportunities for me",4

8216,Introduction to Clinical Data Science by University of Colorado System,Christopher J S,"Sep 15, 2021","The first 2 weeks were informative, challenging, and something beyond my scope for which I was excited to learn. The 3rd and 4th weeks were promoted as applying SQL & R to what basics we have learned. Regrettably for the same, as a visual learner reading the given material did not help much, my background in C.S. helped me better understand SQL, however, that was not the case for R.

I had no prior knowledge of R and I was hoping to be taught at least the basics but what was given was one long document which was troublesome to understand.
Comparatively, SQL was taught more than R, and it would seem the course providers did not want to spend time and energy on R.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to have learned something different and yet useful to my background, will be doing the next course in the specialization next.",3
8217,Introduction to Clinical Data Science by University of Colorado System,Erick C S,"Jan 27, 2023","Pretty good intro course, you get to learn about different types of clinical data, learn and practice SQL on BigQuery, learn and practice R on a web interface through RStudio Server Pro. 
There are some details in some quizzes, where it asks you to input SQL code where it looks that the course hasn't been updated for current BigQuery syntax, but it's easy to figure out. And also one multiple choice question where the answer is ambiguous, since many different alternatives are also correct if you try them on a SQL editor.
The R section can also be a bit of work if you either don't know or barely have any practice with that coding language, in the sense that you'll have to figure out stuff on your own if you got it wrong; but all in all, a well balanced course.",5
8218,Introduction to Clinical Data Science by University of Colorado System,Flora T M,"Nov 19, 2019","Very interesting course & I chose it among many offered by prestigious top university programs. After extensive research, I chose this course because of Coursera's great reputation, and because the certification courses offered by U of Colorado specialize in the clinical data science niche, which I wanted to focus on. I plan to continue (next courses in this specialization). It's not easy, but the course is very good & organized well. The attentive moderators answer questions quickly & don't give up; they're persistent & committed to resolving issues and ensuring the student understands the material.",5

For example, I was having trouble mutating a column, and it turns out I was supposed to use the collect() function before mutation().

However, I will never find out because I am unenrolling after the first set of videos and quizzes.

This course uses arbitrary definitions for concepts like ""healthcare data science"" which can mean a multitude of things and is not inherently focused on financial outcomes as the quiz question in the first section wants you to answer. The course also states things like ""deidentified data can't be used to study seasonal allergies because the dates are shifted"". Date-shifting is one of MANY methods of de-identifying data and the implication of this statement is that seasonal allergy research can therefore only be completed with data containing protected health information. Really?

So yeah, arbitrary definitions, silly grammar mistakes on quizzes, and flat-out incorrect information are the reasons I am not continuing this course and I would advise anyone who does continue to take the information here with a grain of salt. ",1

8312,Advanced Linear Models for Data Science 1: Least Squares by Johns Hopkins University,Andrea G,"Feb 11, 2018","This course is very interesting and Professor Caffo is very good at teaching. The proposed material is not very well organised and even if there are multiple sources available (videos, book, YT videos) they all say the exact same things (literally): it isn't helpful, only redundant. Moreover, I felt a lack of context: yes, it is only a 6 weeks course and yes there is a strict relationship with at least other 5 courses on Coursera (as a prerequisite) so it may be hard to contextualise. Nevertheless the material seems to be taken here and there from other courses/specialisations so you often have the feeling that you are missing something that may have been said in a previous lesson that does not belong to this course (and I am not talking about basic linear algebra stuff) or you wonder ""what are we trying to prove? And why?"". Material desperately lacks homogeneity, and it's easy to lose focus. Last but not least: R is a prerequisite, which is a bit strange since the topic is very theoretical (and there are no practical references throughout the course). R is mainly used by the professor to prove that theory is right (Wouldn't be more interesting to take advantage of R's plotting capabilities to have a visual result of theory?) or there are quiz questions that require the usage of R to get the answer (Why? Am I supposed to learn R or Least Squares?). Sometimes you feel like this is not a standalone, focused course, but an appendix of other specialisations. Overall it's a good course, very interesting topic, made harder by material that is a bit collected here and there and put together without the care the subject would require. My suggestion is to enroll only after completing Statistical Inference and Regression Models (both by B. Caffo) so that language and context are the same.",3

That being said, the course preparation by the lecturer appears quite careless. The videos are difficult to follow, with the electronic pen not helpful to comprehend the handwriting and full of mistakes the lecturer needs to correct constantly. Moreover, the quizs have included errors apparently for a long time, as the forums reflect, and no one has corrected them so far. The book recommended for the course is still in a very poor state, not only unfinished but also full of mistakes, making the task of linking the content it includes with the lecturer's explanations challenging at times. Fortunately, I did not pay for it, as it can be obtained for free if the student desires. However, those who spend the money the platform recommends to pay will have heavy reasons to be upset.",1

The call to action and keeping track of AI developments section at the end is an important addition because developments in AI are happening at lightning speed.

8507,Google AI Essentials by Google,郭鎮峰,"May 14, 2024","I recently completed the Google AI Essentials course on Coursera and wanted to share my thoughts. While the course is well-structured and easy to follow, I found the overall content to be too simplistic. Most of the modules are heavily theoretical and do not delve deeply into practical applications, which was a bit disappointing.

Module 3 stood out as the exception; it was highly relevant to real-world work and provided valuable insights that I could directly apply to my job. However, the rest of the course did not meet my expectations in terms of practical knowledge and hands-on learning.

Overall, if you're looking for a basic introduction to AI concepts, this course might be suitable for you. But for those seeking more in-depth and applicable knowledge, especially for professional use, you might find this course lacking.

So far, It's hard not to think that this is largely a waste of time. After many hours working through the first two courses, only midway through this second course did I actually do something - create a spreadsheet, perform some functions and formulas and make a dashboard. Otherwise, these lessons have been mostly just watching talking head videos and then answering multiple choice quizzes. Very disappointing, and a terrible way to learn something new. The program so far feels very padded, as if the creators knew they didn't have much content and wanted to find ways to stretch the material they have. The rudimentary nature of some of the content is surprising. Maybe Google could take for granted that anyone signing up for this certificate already knows what ""data"" is, as well as ""the cloud,"" and wouldn't need these terms to be defined and quizzed? In the second course, far too much time is spent ""teaching"" proper email etiquette and how to behave during a meeting! At best this should have been optional reading fo those who feel they need it. Way too much time is spent simply regurgitating definitions of terms. It's almost laughable to watch a 5 min video of someone introducing general concepts on a topic, answer a short quiz, and then have the next video begin with someone congratulating me on having learned all about the previous topic.

It seems clear that there is not a skilled educator involved in designing this course or the certificate program in general. This is more a forum for googlers to tell us a few things about what it is like to work as a data analyst rather than actually teaching the necessary skills of data analysis. Why on earth should we be learning about how to be considerate in our meetings as data analysts before we actually learn about data analysis? Honestly this is shameful. Do better, Google.",1
8517,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Andre D M,"Apr 17, 2021","This certificate program is not cutting it. It feels as if Google created a Google doc and asked their entire company to compile a curriculum. Fuzzy overlapping ideas, meandering, droning, endlessly repeating. The material is primarily delivered by ""talking heads"" through video. You will rarely engage in actual technical work or use statistical tools for applied analysis. This is a shame because the great power and utility of state-of-the-art statistical tools is what brings people into Data Science in the first place. Instead, you will hear a lot of stories and manufactured examples of how Googlers and Nooglers (whatever that is) have found success in their practice. Data analysis at Google is a far cry from what data analysts encounter in the broader business world. This is a punishing, miserable experience thus far that will have you feeling like you have spent hours upon hours listening to a seminar without acquiring any technical skills (consider this a review of the first and second course in the 8 course curriculum).",2

8519,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Tiago M,"Apr 22, 2021","The course gives a great overview on how a data analyst thinks, poses questions and prepares their work to start a task on the right path. It also contains useful information on what to do in conflict situations, who to contact and how to politely react and communicate, which I found very valuable. 
My main problem with the courses so far is that they feverishly focus on definitions. The way concepts are explained are very lacking and dry. They are in desperate need of visuals such as graphs, animations and screen captures. All these topics can be perfectly shown visually, so I can't understand the decision to almost exclusively have someone talking to a camera. The people are sympathetic, but all these concepts are abstract! There's a bit of an irony considering we learn that preparing data to stakeholders in a way they can grasp the information is important. So why not treat the students the same way?
The course challenge felt out of place and didn't really build on what we've learnt. It's strange we're focusing so hard on definitions and glossaries, but end up only needing an alarmingly shallow end-test to pass the course. It would profit from a timed exam that has far more questions and that actually makes the student utilize the provided spreadsheets, rather than having it all pre-chewn, only to peek at and ticking one of 4 boxes. Otherwise this course is set on the right foot. It's all there! But the execution feels very lacking and disappointing.

8551,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Elzbieta Z,"Jun 22, 2021","Quite a disappointing and lackluster course, and the title is misleading. Only a small part focuses on asking question and even that part was one-dimensional and biased. Instead of showing different types of questions and angles one dataset can be looked at, we are getting cliche expressions like ""data is everywhere"". Different types of problems weren't properly defined, just illustrated with some random examples. How and if they apply to other industries is hard to say, because we don't even know what they are. This is a real quote from the course: ""Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.""
Suddenly, probably because they needed to fill the course with content, we move dfrom questions to spreadsheets. Even this part was a mix of basic functions like SUM with more complex IFERROR. I absolutely have no idea how did the creators define the target group. As a cherry on top, the QWIKLABS don't work. Bad job, Google, ",1

I had 24 hours to feel anxious, stressed, and felt my confidence levels plummet. It would be great to have the option to have an abbreviated pause after failing the quiz 3 times. Maybe if the student views all the videos and materials for the incorrect questions, they then are given access to another round of tries. I literally feel so overwhelmed and anxious now that my mometum was interrupted and I couldn't utilize the time block I reserved to do my classes today because I was locked out.

The section on stakeholders provided additional insight and good advice (e.g., do not be afraid to say no, focus on the objective) although the course challenge questions on the primary vs. secondary stakeholders were a bit confusing. I also found the advice on teamwork, meetings and conflict resolution very useful.  
Having the information broken into smaller chunks (e.g., 5-minute videos) was very helpful. The periodic short quizzes and flashcard exercises were very useful and helped the knowledge sink in.

8573,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Paco L M,"May 17, 2021","Multiple times throughout the course I encounter a part that gives me the feeling ""Now we're gonna get our hands dirty! We finally get to the meat of the course and get to practice data analysis!"" Turns out, this course is just like the previous one: 80% conceptual. Even simple things like creating pie charts are done for us. This gives me the impression that the course was created and designed by googlers and data analysts but not tested by beginners. I take issue with the idea that Google is using us new students as the front loaders for a new and more successful version of the course. I paid for an excellent education and I'm not even gonna get the whole thing because I live outside of the USA.
Emotion aside, data analysis is a very rhythmic discipline. When performing analysis on a data set, there are subroutines and repeating actions you need to perform on any data set and I firmly believe the course should give us more than one repetition of how to perform these routines or else they'll produce graduates with spotty abilities and holes in their game. And please don't say ""it's your responsibility to practice so and so out of our course"" - we're frickin' paying for this course, it should get us at the very least to adequate, not barely-practiced but chock full of concepts. In fact, since this course has Google's backing, adequate seems like a low bar to clear.
Google's aim for this shouldn't just be to provide students with information, but to structure the course and educate such that their graduates will calmly and assertively navigate and process their first data set using things they learned from google.
To use a metaphor, when you see Mike Tyson box, all those movements are textbook movements drilled into him by Cus d'Amato - not a single step, twist, or punch from the boxer is anything but the moves drilled into him by his maestro. The mind of the teacher has been transplanted wholesale into that of the student and this informs their behavior and choices. ",3

I don't feel I'm paying to learn things like 'show up on time to a meeting' and 'reply to emails in a timely manner'. I would have liked to see the course challenge include actually doing something with the spreadsheets, but instead I was asked to identify a pie chart. I'm having a hard time seeing how the depth of information being presented is going to result in earning a data analyst job. I doubt Google would hire someone who had completed this course, I think they would find their skill set lacking. I hope that the depth of material will improve as I complete the additional courses.

This seems to be geared very heavily to the type of mandatory HR homework you have to do when you're actually hired. I think it's harmful to teach this as a course, because each data analyst position and environment is different. Maybe this is the way it works at Google, but it certainly doesn't have to - it just seems incredibly basic and honestly kind of condescending. I was hoping that the ""Ask Questions for Data-Driven Decisions"" course would have a lot more case study work that actually makes us think of real world problems and how to approach them from the perspective of data research (not what is the appropriate email response to a supervisor who expected a report not to be late).

Data analytics is the process of examining and interpreting data to uncover meaningful patterns, insights, and trends. It involves the use of various techniques and tools to extract valuable information from raw data, with the ultimate goal of making informed decisions and predictions. Data analytics is a multidisciplinary field that incorporates elements of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge.

There are three main types of data analytics:

Descriptive Analytics: Descriptive analytics involves summarizing and interpreting historical data to provide a snapshot of what has happened in the past. This type of analysis helps in understanding trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Visualization tools like charts and graphs are commonly used to present descriptive analytics results.

Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics uses statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. It involves building models that can make predictions or forecasts, enabling organizations to anticipate trends and make proactive decisions.

Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes; it recommends actions to optimize results. This type of analytics suggests the best course of action to achieve a desired outcome, considering various constraints and objectives.

Data analytics is widely applied across industries for purposes such as business intelligence, market research, fraud detection, risk management, healthcare optimization, and more. The increasing volume and complexity of data have led to the development of advanced analytics methods, including big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to extract deeper insights and drive more accurate predictions.",5

I also learned how to use the process of Structured Thinking to zero in on the problem facing a business. The sections on identifying stakeholders and how to use best practices in all my communications with them and team members was very informative. The videos were well crafted and so was the reading materials. What is satisfying for me throughout the course is when I get to hear the first hand stories of real Googlers, what they do and the advice they give to new people like myself who are just starting on the journey towards being a data analyst.

To be honest, i wasn't able to catch up with what context in a course mean and see a whole forests in the process of the course. However, i practiced what i had learned over and over so that as taking steps, i became as much understanding of context of ASK phase and importance of it in an initial state as repeated it.
Above all, for the instructors who lead us to the right direction, i appreciate them and many many thanks and back to them whenever i want to review or see them.

8614,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Dinuka H,"Nov 8, 2023","Asking questions is an essential part of making data-driven decisions. It's the process of inquiry that leads to a deeper understanding of the situation or problem at hand. Effective questions help define the scope of the issue, identify relevant data sources, and pinpoint key performance indicators (KPIs) that need measurement. They also guide the collection of data and shape the analysis process. The right questions, formulated thoughtfully, can uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data, empowering decision-makers to make informed and strategic choices. In essence, questions drive the entire data analysis and decision-making process by ensuring that the right data is collected and interpreted to address the specific issue at hand. So I strongly recommend this course for people  who with thirsty about data analytics !!",5
8615,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Yahya M A S,"Aug 8, 2022","This course hase changed my way of thinking about data, we used to deal with data  as it ready in our hands but, we have never thought of asking questions to get the most out of the data in our hand, or asking questions to learn more about the conditions which may effect our data,questions to discover relationships and correlations in the data.
my thought after I start the course was about questioning the data to get answers, but I found that, in real live the questioning start from asking the stakeholders and problem owners to understand the problem well and to meet the stakeholder expectations, and the asking habit keeps moving with you alonge side of all data analytics phases with different goals to be accomplished in each phase, Many thanks to Ximena for her simply way of teaching, which made it understood to me very well ",5

It was great for most parts, especially for the professional skills related to communication, conflict handling etc. Spreadsheets related course was basic and i guess it will be taught in future courses (as part of the certification), as far as i read. I would have preferred more videos on spreadsheets with examples of key functions used. As for this course, lot of links towards reading materials (a big thumbs up BUT should have been like a small chapter in this course - spreadsheets key functions, for example).

8624,Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions by Google,Stephen L,"Apr 13, 2023","i enjoyed the Analytical approach taken around this module and the best practices of getting the right answers. The pace is not too fast but one area of improvement is:
some of the learning points can be merged into one segment instead of breaking up too refinely. For example, I think the excel portion comprises of some basic 101 stuff (attributes adjustments etc.) which can be streamlined further into a ""refresher"" type of segment. More focus can then be on analyzing and focusing on the interpretation learning.
perhaps you can can gather more ""data"" to validate this suggestion?

1) too little conceptual practice (the quizzes are short and inanely easy)

2) too confusing labs (for someone with plenty of JS, particularly web-related, but no prior python/data-science experience, I struggled to understand how the data structures were being manipulated and to intuit what the helper functions were asking me to do, and plenty of numpy/python errors that I had to interrogate for too long, distracting from the core concept.

 I wish there were more hands-on programming practice; the practice labs etc. often feel like most of the code is written for me and I'm just filling in a line or two. Most of the learning feels like a ""sit and get"" format rather than a hands-on experience, which makes me nervous about how much knowledge I'll retain and be able to transfer. I also think it's odd that, after introducing vectorization in the first course, the labs consistently seem to push us to write implementations using loops.

8674,Advanced Learning Algorithms by DeepLearning.AI,Chien-Wei C,"Jul 16, 2022","This is by far the best advanced machine learning algorithm course I've ever taken. Using simple examples to convey several no so intuitive concepts. Some of the concepts that was not 100% clear prior to this course are now  crystal clear. But honestly, I would say for those who have zero experience in the field of machine learning and coding might find it hard to take in, especially the part when trying to write and understand the algorithm from scratch in the lab.

8676,Advanced Learning Algorithms by DeepLearning.AI,Svetlana V,"Feb 15, 2023","Another excellent course. Dr. Ng's presentations are super clear and easy to follow, graphics/animations are superb.
What I think this course needs is a bit more time/explanation on backward propagation. Here it was touched upon only briefly and in an optional lab, and it was not clear how it tied back into neural networks algorithms. I had to learn this separately on my own by finding articles on Google.
Thanks and looking forward to the next course!",5
