0,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Arjunsiva S,"May 21, 2021","Another useless course in this specialization. The whole course feels like a PR attempt for Google. They care so much about maintaining the colour palette with blue, yellow, green and red (colours in Google logo) but the content is totally useless. This doesn't provide any value. Anyone who is above 18 will definitely know everything in this course. It's a course for 6th graders.",1
1,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Bubíková K,"Jun 30, 2021","This course was (again) a waste of time. It's shallow and doesn't contain any useful information. Totaly basic skills again (sorting data in spreadsheets, select+from+where commands in SQL). In section with metadata topic was some theory but no practical excersice.",1

3,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Farah R,"Aug 9, 2021","As a beginner in SQL and Data analyst world, this course ""Prepare Data for exploration"" open my eyes and enrich my knowledge. I do really enjoy this course. and Excited to move forward. Thank you :)",5
4,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Dilara F,"Jul 12, 2021",The content is so basic. I am very disappointed with the courses so far except the first course. The information about Spreadsheets and SQL is so simple and even a begginner can learn more just by reading the relative pages online for half an hour. I have to pay 10 times more because of the currency of my country and feel sorry for my time and money that I spent so far. ,1
5,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Rachel L,"Mar 25, 2021",Excellent course that provides a robust introduction to working with databases with Google sheets and SQL. Covers bias and data privacy as well. Gives clear definitions and is well taught and paced.,5
6,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Lucas,"Oct 17, 2021","Again another course that is all over the place. You do learn very little about SQL and a lot of theory and concepts that you could read somewhere in less than 15 minutes. At some point I though ""They are finally teaching some technical skills like SQL"" but all of the sudden they jump to how to organize folders and name files and how to create your LinkedIn account. I am very disappointed with this course so far. I hope the next one they teach something meaningful.  ",1

10,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Kim S,"Oct 28, 2021","Very theoretical. Nothing really about SQL and how it works. The things with SQL are mostly spoonfed (i.e. ""Enter the following query to get a result"") rather than explained what every function does and means. No practical exercises w.r.t. SQL. For a course that costs 50$ a month, I expected to have extensive knowledge shared with me, dedicated exercises to a whole array of functions and queries, etc. Unfortunately nothing of that all. Just some typical theoretical mumbo-jumbo that ironically is next to useless on the actual job that we are trying to land with this certificate. To actually learn SQL, it seems I will have to take a separate course on Udemy or another platform.",2
11,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Dmitrii D,"Jul 5, 2021",Thank you for the course! It's a nice introduction to SQL and Google Big Query as well as the concepts of data privacy and security. The course also offers some great tips for professional networking.,5

13,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Mariya A,"Apr 22, 2021","I wouldn't have imagined giving this course 4 stars if it weren't for the amazing work of the QwikLabs team and the ungraded projects included in this course. Superb! My other feedback is that I'm kind of not interested in watching the videos anymore... it just seems like there is so much unrelated talking that is not relevant to the subject matter. I would be great if the material in the videos was organized into a PDF file at the end of each Week and Course so that the information could be easily accessible for review later. GetSmarter, a different online learning platform, does this brilliantly in collaboration with universities.",4

The course is well organized and enjoyable.",5
16,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Nathan W,"Jun 9, 2021","This was quite a good course overall, and I appreciated the instructor's presentation of the material and most of the assignments/questions. However, the quizzes still had some major hiccups at points with what answers were considered correct. (I left feedback about these when possible.)
Additionally, the heavy focus on a platform like Kaggle, which is apparently focused around data science, was rather baffling to me. I'm not planning to go into data science specifically, and in the first course, it was presented as one possible way to use data, which some students of this course might choose to pursue. However, the requirement to explore and use Kaggle in this course belies that, indicating that data science is more required than it should have been. I believe that all of the Kaggle material should be part of an optional module on this course, or a separate course entirely with a strong recommendation to explore for those who are interested in pursuing data science.",4
17,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Kevin K,"Aug 9, 2021","The Content is Good.   The quiz and test questions are 80% vocabulary based questions.   I am not sure that is what you want in trying to teach practical use of the tools.  I have been a Continuous Improvement and Teaching professional for 15 years.  I fully understand the material in Course 1-3, except for SQL.   I feel that the time spent on intro to SQL was way to short.  Understanding what Where means, and what From Means and why you do it, what how it can go wrong, and how you can troubleshoot issues you might occur was something I was looking for in the course and did not receive.

18,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Landon C,"Jul 24, 2022","This course was useless. Absolute garbage, just like the previous two. This is week 12 or 13 now, and I can say that all the information could be summed up in a 30 minute video. There is no reason to pay $39 a month for this dribble. Go on youtube and get more in-depth information for free. Seriously there are far better resources out there. The fact that this was released by Google is just astounding. I've seen TikTok videos that were more informative. I don't want to hear your ""teachers"" life stories. I want to be taught how to actually analyze data. Also your jingle and the little clips of them laughing, or the stupid jokes, do NOT make the people in the videos more relatable. I know its a stupid psychological tactic , but to anyone with two brain cells to rub together, it is incradibly annoying. Especially when you know the video to follow had a 95% chance of holding zero value, but you sit through it anyone hoping something usefull spills out.",1
19,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Dillion B,"Apr 9, 2021","This course was great!

20,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Gustavo C,"May 10, 2021",Amazing teacher! I have learned so much in this process that even my way to think data has changed a lot. Metadata is a new subject for me and through the course I get even more fascinated about data.,5

24,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Deleted A,"Jun 28, 2021","While the the first 3 modules were insightful, the last 2 sections of this course felt like stuffing. The last week in particular should be in an intro to job finding course, not a data analyst course.",3
25,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Rich S,"Feb 2, 2022","I think the course was great and all of the content was excellent, HOWEVER, I WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH THE PROCESS TO GET MY CERTIFICATE!! I WAS BASICALLY HELD HOSTAGE AND FORCED INTO UPLOADING A PICTURE OF MY LICENSE AND PERSONAL INFORMATION ATTACHED TO IT. NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO THEN SHOW MY FACE FROM THE FRONT.....I WAS ALSO FORCED TO TAKE SIDE SHOTS....LIKE A MUG SHOT AT A POLICE STATION.
I AM VERY UNHAPPY AND UPSET WITH THIS PROCESS!!! I LIKE TO KEEP MY PERSONAL INFORMATION PERSONAL.

26,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Emirhan B,"Apr 21, 2021","There are some really useful parts throughout the course should you be interested in making a career in Data Analytics. It provides a lot of recommendations for how you should present yourself and build networking in DA community. The course literally pushes you to take your first steps. At least that's how I felt. Along with this, there are a lot of emphases on the ethical side of data handling and data types. Qwiklabs were informative with Big Query practices. There weren't any issues I encountered with Qwiklabs. It was pretty easy to use. Just make sure you're using Chrome incognito. Hope it all continues like this throughout the specialization. I'm looking forward to have more challenging hands-on practices and graded exercises with SQL, RStudio, and Spreadsheet. I also hope there will be more graded exercises involving Kaggle to some extent as well. ",5
27,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Aisha M M,"Nov 16, 2023","As a beginner, I really appreciated the ease and pace of the course. The videos were explanatory, the reads weren't over-whelming, and the hands-0n activities were very easy to follow and comprehend.",5

34,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Salvador M J,"Jan 1, 2022","I think the course itself is a great way to introduce someone to data analysis but it is advertised as you getting a job with the course only which is possible but from the discussion forums I found that most people need to go through extra training form SQL, Python and Excel. I when advertised as someone with no experience can change careers on this course, the 85% of people getting jobs is skewed but the people already in the field just moving up. I would love to see the success of people changing careers and getting a job in data analytics after only going through this course and no extra training. Also, ran into issues in one or the quizzes, where the system was giving out errors and the way it is set up, the only way to get help is through other people in the course, if you're lucky they have the answer if not, you're stuck. The chat was not help since all they did was advice you to check the forum for similar problems. The course is great but should be advertised as what it is, only and introduction into data analytics not a career changed on its own. ",3
35,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Valeria,"Jul 23, 2021","Information in the first three courses of the specialisation is vague and non-practical at all. Some concepts are too easy, some don't make sense if you didn't have prior experience in programming and databases. Hope the next courses will be more to the point.",2
36,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,LaShelle S,"Nov 26, 2022","I absolutely hate this Google Data Analytic Course so far. First I don't like the mixed formats of learning as far as reading, then listening to a video, then discussion, then activity, then quiz and tests. It would be one thing if all of the reading was together and then all of the video was together but when they are all intermixed it makes it heard to follow along when you have a busy life. I can't flow through the course seamlessly. If I'm reading from my phone and don't have a laptop but an activity pops up that requires me to use my laptop I have to stop or skip around. If I'm driving and listening to a video (which I do a lot) I have to stop when I get to a reading or discussion. I wish it was all the vital information was delivered in one format ie. all reading or all video and then have the other formats as options for people who need extra ways to digest it. The 2nd thing I HATE is not being able to easy see where I am at in the grand scheme of the entire course. There isn't a collapsible timeline that shows every course and corresponding weeks that is visible at all time in a sidebar or somewhere on the page. So when I am in a weeks lessons I can see which course or sub-course that I am in, in relationship to the entire certificate. And then on each page the course isn't numbered, there's just the title but its hard to remember the. titles in relation to the entire certificate. Its so frustrating and confusing. And then when I click o the Google Data Analytics Link it gives me a timeline that isn't in order and again the courses aren't numbered so I can't tell what order they are suppose to be in. ",1
37,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,alvin a,"Jul 27, 2022","The laziness of the curriculum is outrageously disappointing, especially coming from a company as prestigious as Google. Does this lazyness also applies to their company culture?

Like the previous courses, here Google are too lazy to put the more important, technical tutorials on video tutorial format. instead, they put tutorials about SQL and Kaggle only in text format (hands on assignments), which accounts for a minor share of the whole course. The majority of the course is dominated by video explanations from instructors which unfortunately cover duplicate basic topics such as the type of datas, tips, etcs in which could have been in put in text reading format. 

I am very frustrated, because as a student I needed to learn SQL in video format, like those common ""how tos""  youtube tutorial. That is my expectation.  If I needed to learn from external source in order to pass the assignments from this course, that means Coursera, Google and the instructor aint doing a good job teaching.",1
38,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Lara E,"Dec 23, 2021","Definitely aimed at recent high school graduates as ""candy"" and ""ice cream"" companies were their main examples.  Big query didn't work for me.  Despite signing up for the sandbox I received errors that I didn't have permission to access any data.  There are a bunch of attachments to download that aren't even needed to answer the questions so it's irrelevant information and results in wasted time.   Really frustrating.  A lot of the readying was redundant as is mirrored what was said in the previous video.  Additional information with more details in the reading would have been better than the same stuff, just slightly different wording.  Finally, the circular motion repeatedly done with the left hand by the instructor (the only bodily motion at all) was very distracting and annoying. ",1
39,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Carlos R,"Mar 18, 2022","The information of prepare data for exploration in this course is really good, the videos are good, easy to understand so why only 1 star. 

I found two things that I don't agree with. Using platforms with free trials and paid versions, in the videos of BigQuery that we use google cloud platform and sandbox and have to use a trial to study. on those videos we use SQL and nothing more, so there is many ways to learn SQL. The second thing was an exam where 3 questions were asked about Kaggle, social networks and what people think about it. It seemed to me that it was like a market study and questions about how we would think it could be better or what is needed. It seems to me that we were helping them with market research and not learning.",1
40,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Tracey,"Jan 17, 2022","I absolutely love the diversity in the presenters for each of these courses in the program. The presenters were very knowledgeable but were excellent in breaking down the information in a beginner-friendly manner. There was so much content, but possible to learn and understand. I really loved the interactive lessons that gave the learner the plenty opportunity to practice the new content within each lesson.  I really enjoyed this program that helped me to learn what I needed to learn without feeling overwhelmed. It was also extremely helpful that the design of the new information was always presented in a manner that real-world applications.  ",5
41,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Claire C,"Mar 27, 2021","I like this course best among the first four course in the track.

51,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Raven D,"Aug 20, 2022","The SQL section was difficult to follow because a lot of the answers included functions that were not introduced to us outside of the SELECT, FROM, WHERE functions (SUM, COUNT(*), etc.).  I think the SQL section could use some work for complete beginners to understand better.  
The networking section also felt completely out of place with the rest of this course's content.  I believe it should be placed in a section about getting a job about a data analyst, because it kind of throws off the pace of the rest of the course. 
The forced Kaggle sign up and work ins were also a drawback for me.  I didn't like being forcced to sign up for a service in order to proceed with the course. I understand its a useful tool; however, it shouldn't be tied to my progression in the course.

The course was sold to me in a way that I did not need any prior knowledge to succeed in the course material. The SQL and BigQuery education offered in this course and the other courses is not sufficient and is expensive. YouTube has some resources to supplement help where this course is lacking. I'm already almost halfway through these courses, so I do not want to stop. I want to learn this material, but the material is dated and doesn't reflect helpful information in a streamline kind of way.

Almost all of the practice problems on the previous SQL modules were SELECT * and then they ask you to do work problems that were never taught before such as ""How many distinct bike_ids had trip durations greater than 2400 seconds?"" where somehow the learner should know about SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT bike_id) AS num_of_bike_trips.

78,Prepare Data for Exploration by Google,Marina T,"Jun 20, 2021","This course was fantastic! Probably the best one so far, and mainly due to instructor. The instructor was clear, confident and to the point. 
The whole course was interesting, with lots of practical exercises (QuickLabs, Google Spreadsheets/Excel) and designed for complete novices in Data Analysis in the way which allow you memorize things without much effort (I am sure Google has done it on purpose, probably based on some research on how brain creates new  connection).

I will miss this instructor on the next course...
P.S. the only downside is the way they desperately promote Kaggle. At least this is how I felt.  I've also lost two days navigating among links they suggested for learning about ""regexes"" and still don't really get it... I wish they've covered it within a course in plain and understandable way they cover everything.

125,Process Data from Dirty to Clean by Google,Janice R,"Jul 19, 2021","I was really disappointed with this course.  First of all, we were constantly told that data cleaning is the main function of junior data analysts.  Then why not make sure we can do this function.  I finished the course with no confidence that I could data clean using SQL or spreadsheets.  So here are my suggestions.
1.  Less multiple choice questions and more hands on activities.   This course presented a lot of material.  However, there were too few practices.  After every video, there should have been an opportunity to clean  a dataset  using what we just learned.
2.  Each weekly challenge should have been a hands on activity to clean a data set using the skills we just were taught.
3.  The final course challenge SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE CHOICE. which was totally useless.  Instead it should have  been hands on.  I knew the answers but NOT HOW TO DO THE PROCESS. 
4.  For cleaning spreadsheets, I had to go outside of the course and find a free course that took you through the EXCEL spreadsheet cleaning process.  Why should I have to do that?   I still cannot say with any confidence that I can clean data with SQL OR SPREADSHEETS.
5.  The resume section should have been at the end of ALL OF the courses and optional.  It was out of place.

This course could have been good if it was a real course, with real teaching and interraction, instead of a prerecorded MOOC. Especially the section about SQL would benefit from it. Would be nice to, you know, actually learn SQL instead of going from 0 to 100 in one lecture where basic and extra-advanced functions were thrown together.

The content of the course seemed fine and I really did learn some things both in spreadsheets and SQL (of course I was just a beginner in it). The reason for the four stars is that sometimes the BigQuery didn't work (See Discussion for Week 3). In addition, why should we use our accounts when there is QwikLabs? Secondly, the questions asked in the videos aren't challenging enough and the skills needed to answer them using SQL are always the same.

The illustrations and especially animation used in ALL these courses are EMBARRASSINGly juvenile. By what criteria were these graphics selected? As a professional illustrator with an MFA and BFA from CalArts and 30+ years in animation for companies throughout the silicon valley, these are an embarrassment. Appendages are often completely out of proportion (and not purposefully - they are just produced by clearly someone who has zero actual skill in illustration), light sources in images are inconsistent, perspective is incorrect, and the animation is not even at the level of execution as beginning animation students in high school. Did you use ANY criteria here at all beyond maybe who someone is sleeping with or just what floated the decision maker's boat that afternoon? Is this program intended for people that are under 10 years old or is the program supposed to be for any age because if your target is adults as well as young adults, you need to either get rid of this infantile poorly done stuff or go back and use actual professional criteria in selecting illustrations AND HAVE A PURPOSE BEYOND DECORATION AND AMUSEMENT for them (go and maybe take your own UX courses to learn why we don't just throw in a cute illustration to make things... cuter...).

A much easier way I found online is to highlight your table, go to ""Find & Select"" > ""Go To Special"" > Pick ""Blank"" > Now you can delete those rows with Ctrl + minus and pick rows, or you can highlight them, or or or..

Don't miss understand me, but this does not build confidence in learner’s knowledge with the technical side. I would like to give few suggestions in regard what I experienced. 
1 - The concept and principles of data analytics should be gathered ALL in one course, instead of dividing them on several course of the program. Thus open the way for more hands-on activity and practice assignments. 
2 - In weekly challenge, I suggest to be as a data set to be cleaned, and the work of the learners is reviewed by the instructor’s team. 
3 - In SQL parts, there it was not a reading part that summarize what have been said and explained in the videos.
4 - I expected more practice assignment on the SQL, but there was very few. I suggest more in this part.
5 - The resume part was out of context, it should be in the last course of the program to sum up everything introduced in the course, thus helping the learning to link them up together in a more meaningful way.

198,Process Data from Dirty to Clean by Google,Kamila P,"Apr 9, 2023","4th course in the certification and still too much of a ""talking head"" and not enough possibilities to learn appropriate practical skills by following the instructor and by exercises. It barely touches the surface of SQL and spreadsheets.  It's difficult to specify the target audience - sometimes we hear the instructor explaining very basic concepts for a long time, the other time she presents something in BigQuery or Kaggle and doesn't explain properly the context or purpose of the activities. Oh, and spelling out the name of the database over and over again while writing queries instead of fully explaining the logic behind using this or that in the query to resolve a given problem, was ridiculous. 
I still don't see the point in the self-reflection parts - I was asked several times ""why data cleaning is important"" and even the suggested responses were nearly the same in each part.
Not to mention the obvious thing already described by other users - the resume part is out of place and should be included in a separate course.
The most positive aspect was the instructor herself - it seems that the teaching role was more natural for her than for the previous instructors. ",2
199,Process Data from Dirty to Clean by Google,Ammad A,"Jul 12, 2023","I liked the theoretical part of the course but it severely lacks opportunities for practice. If I had only taken this course, I would have learnt very little about either SQL or EXCEL.  Thankfully I found other resources online to practice with.  Instead of including very short almost out of context case studies, I would recommend including a more comprehensive one at the end of the course. All in all, I did gain useful knowledge but the imbalance between theory and practice is hugely disappointing, esp. given the promise they make about making you job ready by the end. ",2

This course introduces you processing data, with a heavy emphasis on data cleaning methodology and techniques. It covers techniques using either spreadsheets functions or SQL to be used when working with databases. I found using SQL to query in BigQuery to be very useful and think that I will utilise that particular platform for performing my own queries with data in future. Getting the opportunity to practice some basic SQL queries, in order to clean data, is very important for an analyst as most of his/her time will be spent cleaning data prior to analysis. The inclusion of preparing documentation and real-world examples, provides a professional standpoint to all of the work involved in this course.

211,Process Data from Dirty to Clean by Google,Jacquewyn C,"Dec 3, 2021","The overall interactivity and timed tests are a welcome addition. I like the clock placed on the quiz efforts. It forces you to really pay attention to the question, and work through a timebox, which I feel assists in developing management. The one issue I had was how the program runs as for overlaps. Some students get caught in the middle of a course reconfiguration. As a result, we lose the results of the quizzes and assignments completed already. This ""catch-up"" puts us closer to a breaching deadlines from the point of disruption, and worse - any affect of the grade negatively, is something the student does not need.

He'd say the same thing several different ways, as though trying to make a difficult concept easier to understand. There were very few things that needed repeating, and the redundancies mainly filled up his video time. That time would have been better used by providing more examples. 
While there was some benefit to using prompt engineering as examples, it was a little too ""meta"" for me. Adding a few everyday examples to the prompt engineering ones (and the other ones) would have been more helpful. I would have liked more examples for the few-shot examples prompt that required intermediate steps. Seeing other ways to write the intermediate steps would have made it much easier to come up wit h an example of my own.
The other thing, which seems to be more a Coursera trend than specific to this course, was the complete lack of assistance in the forums. Years ago, it used to be that teaching assistants - and sometimes the professor - would monitor the forums and answer questions. ",3

If I had a few critiques:
- Some of the audio is off on some of the videos
- I think some of the evaluation of homework output could be automated in the same way that other programming courses can do (i.e. copy and pasting an answer, etc) 
- It would be great to get real life practitioners / enterprises to comment on how they've used prompt engineering to improve their applications or processes",5

270,Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT by Vanderbilt University,Shinysheep “,"Sep 21, 2023","My first and last course ever from Cousera.
I did learn something, but the hard way. 
- The course lacked structure. The various types of prompts were just taught one after the other.
- The material provided is a laughing stock. When learning to prompt, it is important to re-read the examples given. These were not made available. The reading consisted of only a few sentences.
- The examples were fun at the beginning. But they centered around the private interests of the speaker. In the end it was difficult to take it seriously.
- The presentation of the prompts and the results were far too quick. No chance of taking it in.

The weekly tests - A JOKE
-  I had expected multiple choice questions with which you can control achivements. Instead you are asked to come up with a prompt which uses the type of prompt you just learnt about. I spent more time wondering which example to use than focussing on the formulation of the prompt.
UNBELIVABLE: you send your assignments  and immediatly you got your results: 100% correct. I am still speechless. I put all that effort in and have no idea whether I my answer was correct or not.

I am happy that I have a certificate which I can show my employer.
But the next time I will stick to Youtube videos and websites from experts. The graphics provided there are much more helpful.

Coursera: your quality management obviously did not work. 
And sorry, I told lots of people how bad this experience was. ",1
271,Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT by Vanderbilt University,Dan F,"Sep 25, 2023","Fantastic course if you are currently using ChatGPT for just asking it questions or have never used it at all. 

If you take the time to actually watch and pay attention to these videos, use the prompt ideas and make them your own to try out, take notes, read the material, basically all the stuff you would have done in any class in school, you will learn a ton about how to use this tool better and how it works.

I'm 31, and have worked for software tech companies for 10 years and the knowledge from this course will save me hours and hours at work, not to mention make me look good as I can now go teach my co-workers how to save themselves time and bring new ideas to everything we do. 

The reviews that talk about the professor being repetitive - sure, this can be true at times, but this is what teachers are supposed to do in order to reinforce concepts and makes sure students of all levels are understanding the content. If you are finding that you already understand a concept and the professor is repeating himself, just skip forward in the video, it's not a reason not to take the course. 

Last few pieces of advice:
1. For each new prompt pattern, whether you are prompted in the homework or not to do so, take time to think of a use case that's personal for you to use the new pattern for to check it out for yourself. If you are struggling with ideas, just ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm ideas :).
2. There are some links to academically published research papers and while these are a bit dense, I highly recommend you take time to read them, especially the first linked paper about the prompt pattern templates as that will really set you up for success in the rest of the course and for however you're going to use the tool moving forward.

Graded Assignments are of 20 minutes or maximum of 25 minutes but they are pinned that they are of 1 hours, even of 3 hours also, though it take 3 minutes to complete. Please do not get fooled that you will get learning material of 18 hours. The learning material is of 5 hours only and that is also the maximum time I am telling, ideally telling it is of 3-4 hours only.

Positive points:  The amount of information in the course is literally good, you will come to know what kind of prompts you can write to get solution to particular problem you are facing. You can also generate codes of python, html, css, etc. with chatgpt 3.5 but these things are not there in the course. You will be asked to buy one more course along with chatgpt 4 to learn it, so doing it is purely your all choice (though it could be done with chatgpt 3.5). Chatgpt 4 is having other new features as well, you can google them or just ask with chatgpt 3.5 itself. Adding to it, the way of explanation of the lecturer is also very good, he keeps everything simple and concise, along with the easiest and one of the best examples to support his claims, and helping us understand the topic.


As a summary it is depended upon you all what to do with the course, how much you should spend on it.


Chatgpt Summary:

The course is criticized for falsely claiming to be 18 hours long when the actual content is around 7-8 hours, with a significant amount of repetition. Graded assignments, though labeled as 1-3 hours, can be completed in a fraction of that time. However, positive aspects include valuable information on prompt writing for problem-solving and the ability to generate Python, HTML, CSS codes with ChatGPT 3.5. The lecturer's clear and concise explanation, along with practical examples, enhances the learning experience.

315,Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT by Vanderbilt University,Marc G,"Dec 20, 2023","I have been working with LLMs for pretty much every task imaginable to a person for the past 2.5 years. If it can be done with an LLM, i have probably tried it, or seen it. In fact, I've even tried things that aren't usually considered do-able by an LLM, and have attempted those as well, so I considered myself fairly proficient in Prompting. I had even read many of the famous papers on Prompting including Chain of Thought, Code Interpreter with Code-based Self-Verification, Boosted Prompt, Prompt Engineering for Job Type Classification, Progressive-Hint Prompting to improve reasoning, Tree of Thought, EmotionPrompt, Question Decomposition, RCI (Recursively Criticize and Improve), Reflexion, DERA, Factored Decomposition, etc etc etc.

However, even with all that knowledge, I still learned a lot from Dr. Jules White's lessons and examples. His course is easy to follow for anyone, regardless of technical background, and should be essential training for anyone trying to improve their LLM results. For some, you may want to watch the videos at 2x speed, especially if familiar with some of the basic Chain Of Thought prompting, or others, however, watching these is still useful as you can see other ways the professor has attempted to use these prompts. There's a lot of great ingenuity in his methodology and approach, so i can't recommend this highly enough!

so far which is telling, because the whole package and concept has been extremely

formulas and functions, but there is no mention how to read the results you
receive and what are they telling you. Please note the use of the word “about”
in the previous sentence. This is deliberate. You will not learn how to use the
functions, different situations they might come useful etc. They are shown with
no context whatsoever. This applies mostly to the SQL commands. We are
bombarded with more and more complex functions with absolutely no explanation,
and the quizzes and challenges openly instruct: copy and paste this command and
see what happens. Google evidently has zero respect for the students and just
wanted to join the mass MOOC hysteria that started during the pandemic.

specialization and this course in particular. On one hand, they treat you as if
you’d never seen a spreadsheet or even a number before, on the other, in order

398,Analyze Data to Answer Questions by Google,Usama A,"Apr 29, 2023","Just a terrible, awful course. Ruined the whole momentum for me and now I feel scammed.

A course so heavily situated with Data Structure and Consistency, the course videos themselves didn't even make sense. A  heavy complex query is taught( taught is not the correct word here, fast reading makes more sense) in an earlier week then later on in the next week you get the definitions for it with a much simpler query (Group By for eg).

The instructor was in such a hurry in every video that it actually gave me anxiety. All as she kept smiling while I was having a mental break down. The only saving grace for me is that the previous 4 courses actually did a good job of teaching me the basics, so I have hope for the remaining 2 courses.

409,Analyze Data to Answer Questions by Google,Kamila P,"Jul 3, 2023","I can't rate it higher, especially comparing it to free online content. This whole analytics certification is way-too much theoretical and full of fluff, but this course is the worst so far. This is sad because this course should supposedly cover actual analysis. 
Everything in this course is poorly prepared - the range of topics, the order, the explanations, the examples, jumping back and forth between SQL and spreadsheets, the number of mistakes and not updated information, and sadly, the presenter is just not good at explaining things.
This course is mostly about watching the instructor typing the code, with no proper explanation of why we choose to use this or that.  And if you REALLY want to learn something from the videos, not just pass the tests, you will spend a huge amount of time pausing the videos & searching for the proper explanation of the syntaxes elsewhere (if you don't believe me check the topics on the forum). Eventually, you will end up knowing really little compared to what you will know after spending the same amount of time doing a proper SQL course. 
We are constantly being told how much we've learned, while the truth is we were watching the demonstrations in SQL most of the time (not to be confused with following the instructor while going through the scenario). I believe those surprisingly good grades come from users who believed that they've ""learned a lot"" because they're unaware of the real expectations in a real job. Finish this course and try to apply what you've supposedly learned by using the presented commands (the more complex and nested ones too) in real scenarios, and you will see what I mean ;)
And finally, I'm confused when it comes to the name of the course - a lot of content on preparing or cleaning the data, but little on the analysis itself.
I'd advice other users to switch completing the weeks 3 & 4, as the queries in week 3 are more difficult than those in 4.",1

As others have stated in their reviews, the difficulty of this course is significantly higher than that of the first four courses for the certification, but almost needlessly so. A lot of the difficulty stemmed from the fact that many of the SQL statements simply _do not_ work as written in BigQuery, despite the video showing them written and executed in BigQuery.
Concepts explained in the later parts of the course are used as part of numerous SQL statements in in the earlier parts of the course without any introduction or explanation. Many of the SQL statements are also used without any explanation at all.

The course should make use of the intracourse SQL functionality more frequently and in graduated complexity before introducing the use of BigQuery.  The gates, tested material is too simple to ensure that students have acquired pre-requisite skills before introducing subsequent material.",3
472,Analyze Data to Answer Questions by Google,Norman C L,"Oct 7, 2021","I think the course materials are excellent and relevant, but it didn't do a good job explaining some important concepts, specifically the Subqueries in SQL. Not only did the course fail to explain the relevance and the motivation to initiate subquery, the pace of how different lines do and interact with the core main query way too fast. In addition the time needed to debug the queries to make it work quadrupled at least.  How different commands interact (Count/Group By) is also not adequately explained. Going forward, I think it would be more important to use visualization to explain the different parts of the Queries and how they interact, together to form a complex query on SQL. In the final quiz, the spreadsheet had a bug that prevents SORT function to function properly, with regards to sometime about circular and such. Overall it is a challenging course compare to the previous ones, and I hope they could make it much more clearer when doing these type of analysis. ",3
473,Analyze Data to Answer Questions by Google,Aditya K,"Feb 25, 2024","I'd like to share my thoughts on the course I recently took, giving it a rating of 3 out of 5 stars. Overall, it was a valuable experience, but there are some areas where it could improve.

One aspect that stood out to me was the SQL section. While the content was there, it felt a bit rushed. I believe it would have been more beneficial to separate the teaching of subqueries and JOINS. By introducing and providing hands-on experience with each separately, learners could grasp the concepts more effectively. Then, once both were understood, combining them in practical exercises would have solidified the learning process. 

Despite this criticism, the course still offered valuable insights, and I was able to gain a good understanding of the material. With some adjustments to the teaching approach, it could become even more beneficial for future students.",3
474,Analyze Data to Answer Questions by Google,"NG, S L","Jul 11, 2021","The whole specialisation so far (courses 1-5) is just talking without doing. Hands-on experience/practice is really crucial for us to learn and debug our programs. Although labs are provided, it is mostly copy and paste without further explanation. Comparing this to ""Managing Big Data with MySQL"" by Duke University, the latter has more training to hone our SQL skills and learn through practice. I would not have understood the queries if it weren't for my previous encounter with SQL in another course. Also, the learning curve is gradual in the latter, while Google's goes from 0 to 100 quickly. Last but not least, I think Google should have separate courses dedicated to joins and subqueries respectively. Subqueries are complicated man, give us exercises instead of just links to external sources!",3

Further, some public datasets referenced in the course material is already unavailable in Google Public Datasets. I expected some statistical methods and tools to be taught as well, but there is none of that here.

This was especially prevalent in the videos on using SQL.

500,"Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning by DeepLearning.AI",Anupam,"Dec 1, 2022","The best thing this course did for me was to remove the enigma of machine learning. This specialization is not so much about going deep into individual machine-learning algorithms and techniques as it is about exposing a student to the broad spectrum of all the different kinds of problems for which machines can be programmed to learn a solution. Once a student completes this course, they have a very good idea of the kinds of problems that can be solved by letting machines learn how to solve those problems and specific algorithms/techniques that need to be used for that particular kind of problem. A student can then research additional resources for the specific problem they have at their hand and take a deep dive into developing a working solution for their specific problem.

The difficulty is fine, could be more challenging actually and also require you to do more than what was explained in the videos. The annoying part are the unit tests. I almost always get a fail even though my functions return the expected output. I have compared my function to the solution and I always get the same results. I do not know how the unit tests are designed but they do not fulfill their purpose. It is frustrating that I have to write functions in a pre-dedfined way to get a pass even though my function generates exactly the same output. Even more frustrating that the explanatiosn in the notebooks do not explain why the function has to be written exactly in that way, when a  more efficient way with less or even no for loops is possible. I would recommend to rather play around and write your own classes on your local machine and compare output to scikit-learn algorithms.

When the course materials are of top class and design and presentations are excellent but outsider from computer science background like me feels the implementation of any concept in the lab overwhelming because compare to what the lab already implemented and what I completed in my exercise was one or two snippets. It is very exciting to see that you have implemented a linear regression model or a recommender system or anomaly detection or land  a rover on the surface of the moon but disappointing in a sense that in reality I have not planned it , design it or   even do not know how it happened. Of course, the implementation provided full format and complete example if anybody wish to simulate it  and replicate it but person like me need more help in the format like explaining how you have designed all those codes, how these works, and how to recruit all these relevant libraries.

Just one STRONG suggestion. the last  graded lab in week three, based on reinforcement learning has a shortcomming that it uses graph tensors. this really messes up the code and makes it hard to use. Infact i myself dedicated three hours to debugging it to realise, that the tensors used in the code are modified and cannot be converted to numpy arrays. This made it impossible to code for it. please look into this matter. Thankyou",5

I felt this way after the first course of this series, but even more so now. Yes, I understand the material, but the programming assignments really don't amount to more than ""filling in the blanks""--that doesn't really test whether or not I've mastered the material. I understand that this is terribly hard to accomplish through a MOOC, and having taught university-level courses myself, I understand how much effort is involved in doing so in the ""real world"". In either case, if I'm paying for a course, I expect to have a solid grasp on the material after completing the material, and though you've clearly put effort into assembling the programming exercises, they don't really gauge this on any level. Perhaps it would be worth considering a higher cost of the course in order to justify the level of effort required to put together assessments that genuinely put the student through their paces in order to assure that a ""100%"" mark genuinely reflects both to you and the learner that they have truly internalized and mastered the material. It seems to me that this would pay off dividends not only for the learner, but also for the you as the entity offering such a certificate.",1

This course contains a lot of relevant and useful material, and is worth studying, and complements the first course (and the free ML course very well).
The labs, however, are not particularly useful. While it's good that the focus of the labs is applying the actual formulas and algorithms taught, and not really on the mechanical aspects of putting the ideas in actual code, the labs have structured basically all of the ""glue"" and just leave you to basically translate formulas to the language-specific construct. This makes the lab material so mechanical as to almost take away the benefit.
The TensorFlow section was disappointing. It's really difficult to learn much in a 15 minute video lecture, and a lab that basically does everything (and oddly, for some things leaves you looking up the documentation yourself). I didn't get anything out of this lab, other than to get a taste for what it looks like. What makes it even worse is TensorFlow framework uses some different jargon that is not really explained, but the relevant code is almost given to you so it doesn't matter to get the ""correct"" answer. I finished the lab not feeling like I knew very much about it at all. It would have been far better to either spend more time on this, or basically omit it.
As with the first course, it is somewhat disappointing lecture notes are not provided. This would be handy as a reference to refer back to.

Although I do appreciate very much the efforts put in by the instructors for the programming assignments, I can't help but thinking I could have learnt much more if the instruction were *LESS* detailed and comprehensive. I found myself just ""filling in the blank"" and following step-by-step instruction without the need to think too much. I'm also slightly disappointed with the practical assignment of Tensorflow where everything is pretty much written out for you, leaving you with less capacity to think and learn from mistakes.

This course is the 2nd in a 5 part series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning on coursera. I believe it is useful to take this course in order and makes sense as a part of the series, though technically it is not necessary.
The course covers numerous tuning strategies and optimization strategies to help seed up as well as improve the quality of the machine learning output.  It is very well planned and comprehensive (to the extent possible) -- and gives the student a very power toolbox of stratgies to attack a problem.
The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intution using analogies and real-life examples.  The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well.  The programming exercises are the best part of the course.  They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school.

The lectures by Prof. Ng are amazing, comprehensive and intuitive. The prof starts from first principles of simple neural networks and goes onto show concepts like normalization, bias, variance, overfitting, underfitting, regularization, dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, exponentially weighted averages, stochastic, mini batch and batch gradient descent, momentum, RMSprop, Adam optimization, batch normalization and intro to deep learning frameworks. He not only gives the mathematical foundations and code implementations of each concept, but spends a lot of time explaining the intuition behind it, so that we grasp the concept well. It's amazing how he starts from decade old neural networks in the first video, and within 2-3 hours of lecturing, he brings us into the state-of-the-art deep learning models. Thank you Prof. Ng!
But the notebooks have many flaws. The lectures don't set you up for the programming needed in the notebooks. The descriptions in the notebooks are lacking proper tutorial in many places, leading the students incompetent for the exercises that follow. Example: Week 3 tensorflow tutorail; the sigmoid function exercise; the description above the exercise doesn't really teach you how to effectively use placeholders and variables.

668,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",David S,"Sep 6, 2020","There are both areas needing improvement and places where this course excels.
To begin let's consider what I think needs improvement.
Since this program says that it does not require prerequisites, it really ought to provide backup reference materials specific to course content. Specifically I found it difficult to follow details without the basics of differential calculus, matrix algebra, Python, and TensorFlow. One alternative is to hire a tutor, which is what I did.
Although there is an active community and tutors, support from the course's owner deeplearning.ai  can be improved. For example there are comments in the forums about how long it takes deeplearning.ai to fix bugs in the code.
My last suggestion for improvement is how this course is taught. There is so much content that questioning needs to be more frequent. Currently grading is done through ten multiple choice questions and a programming exercise after a week's worth of videos. While the programming exercises are good, learning would be improved significantly by including three or four questions with each video, even if they are not graded.
Overall, I have the sense that deeplearning.ai has not been improving or updating this course.
Nevertheless this course still deserves four stars. The presenter is well organized, articulate and enthusiastic. The entire course follows a coherent plan.  This course and its predecessor supplies a great deal of content.  Each video runs 6 - 10 minutes on average which is about the right length, However I was always stopping them to write down points to better grasp the content.
As mentioned, there are a few bugs in the programming exercises. However they are rigorous, cover the material, and effort has been made to make them interesting.
Overall, while there is room for improvement this is still a worthwhile course. ",4

1. All the topics are arranged in logical order. So you feel like a tour of deep learning. Earlier I had to refer to multiple sources for different topics and they usually had different naming and notations which were really confusing.
2. Having taken about 6 top rated courses on AI domain, I can assure you Andrew Ng is the best in his teaching style and content.
3. Exercises and theory go hand in hand. So, you know how to implement as soon as you learn theory.
4. Out of a lot of techniques in each topics like Optimization, Regularization etc. this course picks the most contemporary techniques. This helps you not to wonder which techniques to use in your work.
Overall, This Specialization is like a cookbook for AI. My appreciation and gratitude to Andrew Ng and his team for their contribution to AI.",5
676,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Shibhikkiran D,"Jul 8, 2019","First of all, I thank Professor Andrew Ng for offering this high quality ""Deep Learning"" specialization. This specialization helped me overall to gain a solid fundamentals and strong intuition about building blocks of Neural Networks. I'm looking forward to have a next level course on top of this track. Thanks again, Sir!
I strongly recommend this specialization for anyone who wish get their hands dirty and  wants to understand what really happens under the hood of Neural networks with some curiosity.
Some of the key factors that differentiate this specialization from other specialization course: 
1. Concepts are laid from ground up (i.e you to got to build models using basic numpy/pandas/python and then all the way up using tensorflow and keras etc) 
2. Programming Assignments at end of each week on every course. 
3. Reference to influential research papers on each topics and guidance provided to study those articles. 
4. Motivation talks from few great leaders and scientist from Deep Learning field/community.",5
677,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Weinan L,"Feb 5, 2018","Used to tune hyper parameters based on experience... after this course, know more about the internals and from now on, not just know HOW to tune, but WHY it needs to tune this way. 
As always, Andrew did fantastic work here to help explain complex formulas in simple and CLEAR way. 
Highly recommend it to anyone who fight with overfitting, hyper parameters tuning, etc.  It may not help you instantly become a better AI person or help you immediately help you on your day to day programming - as you most likely use various frameworks (Keras/TensorFLow/PyTorch) instead of raw NumPy. But it does help you in the long with better knowledge.  It is kinda like show you how the engine works, before teach you more driving skills.  It won't help you when your car is working fine, but when it breaks, you know how to troubleshoot and what is the right direction to go.  Honestly, I personally think the debugging part is the toughest part of AI. 
Take it. Period. ",5

Taking this course really helped me to learn and study this field and also to implement it. It helped me advance in my knowledge. This course helped me defining Deep Learning field, understanding how Deep Learning could potentially impact our business and industry to write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Machine Learning. 
This specialization helped me identifying which aspects of Deep Learning field seem most important and relevant to us, apparently they were all important to us. Walking away with a strong foundation in where Deep Learning is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it.
Deep Learning specialization helped me achieving a good learning and knowledge about that field.

Prof. Andrew doesn’t just tell you the name of a function for a library (like scikit
learn or tensorflow) and give you magic numbers for parameters. You actually build the model yourself and learn what the parameters stand for and what is the purpose of those parameters and hyper-parameters.
The specialization is well divided into meaningful courses and each course is well structured so that you know exactly what you are going to learn and what key specific skills you will get after completion of a course. Because of the quizzes and practical labs, after completing a course you actually gain confidence that you can design optimized solutions for that particular set of problems.",5
680,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Alec T,"Jul 29, 2022","Outside of an academic space, I think this course is one of the best places to be introduced to deep learning. It think it does a tremendous job of orienting you around issues relating to implemention of neural networks for deep learning. The information if transferred in an efficient and concise manner - the videos are created in a way that are not too long or too dense in any one sitting to be overwhelmed. I do think this course is best supplemented or partnered with a course that requires more implementation and generation of neural networks. The activities can be performed swiftly if you have been paying attention to the lectures, which may leave some wanting slighty more from an application perspective. I can however admit this is just the 2nd course of 5 in the specialization so take this information with a grain of salt. ",5

The materials are easy to grasp, and the content is well-planned; I highly recommend the course. It provides a comprehensive overview of the subject matter, and Andrew Ng is knowledgeable and engaging. 
As a plus, the interviews with the heroes of Deep Learning provide invaluable insight to newcomers to the Deep Learning domain. 
The course materials are well-organized and easy to follow, making it easy to stay on top of the material. Additionally, the assignments are challenging but manageable, allowing ample opportunity to practice and apply the concepts learned in class.

It shows the mathemical fundamentals behind the concepts, without going too deep to confuse a person without advanced calculus knowledge, like me.
However, I would like that the following changes were made:
Update last week lab to Tensorflow 2.0. This framework update seems to be more beginner friendly, because its interaction with Python functions (no need for sessions). Also, a lot of things shown in the lab are deprecated.
Make a lab for hyperparameter exploration. While this task can take a relatively long time, maybe it would be feasible to explore hyperparameters over a simple model. I felt that the course needed more hands on in the part of exploration.",5

While already had a certificate in CNN and Google's  Tensor Flow platform, I needed to understand the inner workings of forward and backward propagation.  Great combination with Andrew NG (as usual), Jypter notebooks, and the development personnel on topic segmentation,   progress, and testing. I loved the ""gentle"" approach to calculus, differential and partial differential equations and linear algebra. While a periodic note would pop up saying that xx% of people taking this course viewed this particular segment twice, I chose to realy view it in detail. This meant producing a chapter (for each segment with the transcript), adding equations from Andrew's drawings, using and pasting in any Excel computations, and highlighting and emphasing important topics.",5
684,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Anirudh K,"May 9, 2020","This is a really informative course and really crucial if you are planning to do a personal project or even prepare for interviews. It equips you with all the tools to get started with actually start implementing Neural Networks for a problem by 1) Teaching how to prepare data sets 2) Regularization/dropout to increase accuracy on test set, 3) Set up your optimization problem 4) Teach different  Optimization Algos 5) Teach Hyperparameter tuning and the order of importance of different hyperparameters 6) batch Normalization and lastly Tensorflow. Andrew NG is truly a master in teaching concepts in an approachable and intuitive way. I believe the course can be made even better by adding Keras to the programming frameworks module along with more videos and programming exercises for data pre processing.",5
685,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Jacob J,"Jun 5, 2023","Excellent course tailored to motivate and educate a real practitioner and less for a researcher. 
(1) Loved the course, especially, the intuition-focused approach and not going through each of the mathematical derivations, but focusing on the concept behind the use of each mathematical strategy.
(2) The quizzes didn't make it easy and ensured that the concepts were well grasped.  Need the ability to save the answers for further review and study.
(3) The programming assignments were of the right level of difficulty. These assignments may feel easy for someone looking to reinvent the wheel by coding from scratch. However, for a practitioner, the assignments reinforce the sequence of steps in one's mind and help focus on programming areas where one is most likely to make mistakes.",5
686,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Valery R,"Aug 17, 2021","The content of the course is great, but I didn't like at all the final programming assignment on TensorFlow. I'm not a fan of all those third party libraries, or software (not sure how this should be called) which add one more layer between the user and the machine. We call functions without really knowing what we are doing. We just do what the assignment tells us to do. That's relatively easy, but it the assignment could be done without understanding the content of the course. All we have to is simply follow the instructions. We end up with a 100% grade, and we almost have no clue about what we did. I prefer much better to program my own implementation of the neural network in C++ (or Python since this is fashionable), which really forces me to understand what I am doing.",5
687,"Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization by DeepLearning.AI",Nigel S,"Jun 10, 2019","It explains a bunch of complicated maths and methods in a way that is at least comprehensible by mere mortals, though not necessarily easy. Put another way, if this course doesn't enable you to understand how to tune and optimise deep neural networks, then you probably never will.
The content taught in this course is really valuable because it explains a lot of what is going on behind the scenes in the existing Deep Learning Frameworks like Tensorflow, Keras, etc, and enables you to be a lot more competent and confident in producing effective models in a time-efficient way, than if you didn't have this knowledge.
It also seems to have been built by peopel who not only know the material intimately, but who recognise that many of the learners are very time-poor.",5

He had spent a day struggling to figure out how to improve  the performance of his model to improve the accuracy for training and validation (aka dev) dataset, and then figure out why his model was so inaccurate for test set, even as his model was very accurate for the dev set. After going through just the first week lessons of this course, I was able to suggest to him what approaches to take to optmize hyperparameters of his model to get the desired accuracy for all datasets (tarining, dev and test).

Very good to get going on Deep Learning. I have some comments on the course curriculum, regarding the optimization techniques(OTs). The theory presented here is good, but as a learner seeing it for the first time, I didn't get a deep intuition on why we are doing a particular OT and why we need different OTs. So I learned this part from the NPTEL course on Deep Learning by Mitesh Khapra, where he first mentions the reason behind developing an OT, and then he deep dives into the implementation of the technique. In a great way, he developed the concepts on Momentum, NAG, Adagrad, RMS Prop, Adam progressively. Probably an extra video on the analogies behind the OTs can be added on coursera:)",5

In contrast, this is my second course in the deep learning specialization and I feel like so far the courses have struck a good balance, introducing core concepts and derivations for things but also making sure I get guided practice along the way, and also not moving straight to frameworks but having students code more or less from scratch first. I'll probably need some practice on kaggle or other datasets as well as reference to a few other learning materials to feel like a strong practitioner, but this gives the tools to make that possible and I'm very satisfied with this result.",5

I was guided through the nitty-gritties of neural networks, fortunately with a strong emphasis on Computer Vision (my area), deep diving in coherent coding exercises. Prof Andrew, as always, managed to connect the points between theory and practice, recollecting the concepts treated in past lectures, while showing how Tensorflow operates and how to use it. If you ask me, I'd say that the slides of the Machine Learning course used to be better than the slides for the 4 courses in this specialization, in the sense of being useful as studying guide for the future. The current slides only make sense to those who went through the course. ",5

pros: + workflow to address and optimize your supervised learning problems
          + wide and easy-to-get overview on most essential concepts 
          + improves your understanding  of NN; those who are already familiar with these concepts might still benefit from this clear and insightfull presentation
cons: - programming assignment will not suffices to give you a sufficient knowledge of tensorflow to make your own applications, you should integrate a bit. (However, mastering tensorflow is not the intention of the assignment).",5

Par contre l'introduction à tensor flow n'est pas très bien expliquée selon moi (seul petit point faible) mais ce n'est pas l'objet de cette partie je pense.

With step by step teaching us a lot of useful skills to train our model much faster, Andrew starts to put more attention on practical field, and rather than giving us many equations, he as before likes to use some vivid examples for giving us an intuition, which I think is very helpful to understand those scientific words of computer science. But it doesn't mean, that this course is perfect, even I gave a full point to it. The subtitles have a lot of mistakes and the audio is also poorly processed. Sometimes, you will hear the same words twice.

It showed me practical aspects of machine learning, including how to chose the hyperparameters and how to use tensor flow. My only complain is that I'm not sure how much of this information I will retain given that the practical exercises are guided. They build a lot of the functions for you. Still I'm giving it 5 stars because I have not seen this problem solved so far in any other Coursera course. They need to find a balance between teaching you a lot and making it easy enough for most people to be able to pass the exam and not get stuck in the details. Probably they could offer extra practice automatically graded exercises for those of us who want to make sure we won't forget the material. ",5

It is a great followup to Deep Learning and Neural Networks.
My one 'complaint' is that the mathematical depth is too shallow for someone like me (PhD, Mathematical, Computational and Experimental Physics)
It would be great if there was a course that was targeted to people with advanced STEM degrees, and years and years ( 4 decades in my case) of software engineering experience, where more time was spent on the mathematical framework, and the basic algorithms; that way, I'd have the satisfaction and pleasure of constructing the full algorithm implementations myself.

For $50 this course is a steal; you could go gather all the information & struggle through it yourself but be prepared to spend a lot of time & effort sifting through mis-information. 
After taking the 1st coarse I was impressed; course 2 follows in a similar vain. Some of the courses offered through Coursera are more polished than others; if you're at all curious in deep learning, or even if you've already begun your studies, do NOT miss out on this opportunity.",5

One thing I would like to say is that there are quite a few problems with the sound, especially the trailing emphasis on the 'sss' sounds is very annoying and distracting. Also, there should have been a pointer visible on the screen. As the videos now are, when Andrew says something like ""... for this equation here...""

The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects).

Tensorflow has this funciong than can adapt on the go your parameters so your optimization can push that loss lower and lower.

At last, the most fascinating is to construct Tensorflow, just like a pipeline, step by step , and every step was made by only one line, from forward (without backward) to the model, Tensorflow is really black magic.

What we learned in this course is some of the critical implementation details/tricks from the past decades of making them work in practice.   Going beyond gradient descent, types of regularization, hyperparameter searching we get to a set of robust tools that quickly find good solutions in extremely high dimensional spaces.  As Professor Ng says, our understanding of optimization rules of thumb in low dimensional spaces doesn't carry over to deep learning.  ",5

You start with implementing the low-level functions that make up a deep learning framework. It's only in the last assignment that you explore TensorFlow. At that point, you have a full understanding of what the API encapsulates.

875,Share Data Through the Art of Visualization by Google,vivek k,"May 3, 2021",the course is more like Soft Skills Class and less like visualisation class. Theory part is unnecessarily long and practical is too short,1
876,Share Data Through the Art of Visualization by Google,Ince A,"May 27, 2021","This course was absolute torture. So much for keeping the audience engaged while telling a compelling story. While courses 2-3-4-5 kept the theory and the tool learning parallel, the designer of this course chose to go for endless rants, with minimum tool training. It's like they did everything possible to NOT show you how to use Tableau. There was only one thorough practical exercise with Tableau; everything else was a never ending succession of videos about art theory. This course should be completely redesigned, and start on week 1 with how to use Tableau, and drop your ""McCandless Method"" wisdom pearls here and there. The quizzes were horribly hard and served no purpose.",1

878,Share Data Through the Art of Visualization by Google,Katie H,"May 17, 2021","Honestly, I did not enjoy this course at all and found myself rushing through most of the content.

What a person will learn in this course if he enrolled in learning Tableau?",1
880,Share Data Through the Art of Visualization by Google,Dario S,"Apr 20, 2021",Didn't like it. Too many slides and way too many words/vidz for 4/5 simple concepts.,1
881,Share Data Through the Art of Visualization by Google,Nathan W,"Jul 23, 2021","While this course did provide some valuable introductions to data visualization and presentation, on the whole it suffered greatly from one of the same problems that has plagued this whole certificate program: bad questions on the quizzes. Many of the quizzes used questions or details that were barely covered in the videos and readings, or were certainly not emphasized to the degree that they should have been if they were important points to be remembered (as a quiz should be testing a student on). It seemed as if someone unfamiliar with the course material went through the video transcriptions and pulled out random lines, then created questions based on those fragments of text.
Additionally, while not being a specific fault of this course but more of depersonalized online learning as a whole, many of the topics in this course are not suitable for answering in a multiple-choice or multiple-answer format. Instead, they should be handled as graded free-response—but that would require teaching manpower that simply isn't available.
I have to add that, while Kevin Hartman is undoubtedly a fantastic data analyst (or else he wouldn't be Head of Analytics at Google), he is not a good teacher of the material. He did not seem to have a good grasp of what a student who is completely new to the material would need to know, and in what order. He presented a lot of great ideas and gave many resources, but without much guidance in how to process those resources and use them actively for creating data visualizations or presentations. He also skipped around a lot and did not fully explain what he was doing in numerous videos, such that someone else had to come in later and add notes during the videos to explain where Kevin had gone off to in order for the student to follow along.
All told, this course had some value, but rather less than most of the others. Some of that has to do with the inherently more subjective nature of data visualization and presentation, as opposed to previous courses in this certificate program which were based on more concrete and objective topics. However, I do think that the course could have been significantly better.

The  good part is: you are introduce to the McCandless method that is very good. You have to learn that this course, it is way, try to teach you the key points  of communicating something. First, you need to know that  the best way to teach something to someone is to try to use the 5 senses. This way people who is listening to you tend to remember things better.  for presentations, visual and sight. After the senses, you  need to know that people love a good story.

It alternated among video lectures, hands-on learning, and reading assignments; so it never becomes tedious.  You get the opportunity to learn from several people at Google, including their Director of Analytics; so you really are learning from the experts in the field.
The class exceeded my expectations, not only teaching me how to use Tableau (which was my primary goal in taking the class) but also teaching me principles of design AND how to deliver an effective data presentation to stakeholders.  The principles of design equipped me to optimize my data visualizations for any audience, and the presentation skills prepared me to incorporate my data visualizations into a larger data story aimed at resolving real business problems.
I can't say enough good things about this course.  I will end with one note about the time it takes to complete the class. If you are working full-time, then you will be able to stay on pace to complete the class in the expected four weeks.  But if you are learning full-time, then the class is doable in 4 days.  You can make it a goal to complete each Week of material in a single day.  Some might say that is too much information in a short period of time, but if you take good notes, bookmark the online resources, and print the other resources; you can reference the information anytime you need when you are creating future visualizations and presentations.",5

The time allocated to Tableu is effective but it is only a small component of the material.  A larger element of the course is design considerations and presentation guidelines.  These topics were covered well although again pitched toward introductory learning.  The instructor brings an academic/university theoretical approach at times which differs from the practical focus of previous courses.  At times the assessment material is focussed too heavily on semantic differences and definitions rather than a higher level of conceptual understanding.

Here's my detailed review:
The course content was incredibly comprehensive, covering a wide range of data visualization techniques and tools. From basic concepts to advanced visualizations, it provided a thorough understanding of how to effectively represent data visually. The modules were well-structured, allowing for a progressive learning journey.
The instructor's expertise and teaching style were commendable. They presented the material with clarity and enthusiasm, making complex concepts easy to grasp. Real-life examples and case studies were used to demonstrate the practical application of data visualization techniques, which greatly enhanced the learning experience.
One aspect that stood out was the emphasis on hands-on learning. The course provided numerous opportunities to apply the concepts through interactive exercises and projects. These practical exercises not only solidified my understanding but also allowed me to develop my data visualization skills in a meaningful way.
The availability of additional resources, such as supplementary readings and discussion forums, was a valuable aspect of the course. It enabled me to delve deeper into specific topics and engage with fellow learners, creating a supportive learning community.
The only minor drawback I found was the occasional lack of visual examples in certain sections. While the course extensively covered the theoretical aspects of data visualization, a few more visual demonstrations could have further enriched the learning experience.",5

Your analysis can be brilliant but it's only smart if it can be crystallized into sensible language that will resonate instantly with your audience. Thanks Kevin and company. It's changed my mindset as to how to artfully sythesize data into insights. It's one of those things that looks easier than it is and reinforces the need to let the overriding question being asked permeate every visual explanation.

A lot of ""tools and techniques"" seem to explore key terms and applying it to practical settings with a few tips for best practices to boot. No technical tools/techniques so far unfortunately, although this is the ""foundation"" course. 
My main issue is the way in which the questions are structured as well as the answers that accompany them. They are almost similar (answers) which often led me to think ""both of these are correct"" but then I will be told that one of them is wrong and the explanation justifies both answers! Another is the answer for the purpose project sponsors in a project is NOT ""invest time and resources"" despite the fact they actually do invest resources, just not time perhaps?

There was only one example before approaching the final projects so that I proceeded with high uncertainty. This made it feel quite like hitting a wall at the end. Perhaps it was intentional, and perhaps it was the best way to learn, but it's always unpleasant when a course suddenly becomes drastically more difficult to complete the next step, as it can throw off course completion scheduling.  

It was also difficult to actually connect with anyone through the discussion forum/messaging boards system, which was sad, since I read a lot of posts of people I would love to meet.

And there was the issue of audio to text errors, missing data, and other issues that indicate the course could use additional editing to improve quality.

However, I learned a lot, and I would take it again. If I'm comparing it to other courses, I'm sure I won't find better. The scripts and videos were high quality. The information logical in its progression, informative and valuable.

1135,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,mark m,"May 28, 2021","No jobs. In Week 4 of Course 8, there is the Googlecerts Coursera Job Platform. Some may call it Consortium. It's linked under ""Practice Quiz: End of Cert. Checklist."" I did a search for ""data analyst."" All the jobs seemed to require previous relevant exp. or education. Most req. bachelor's or higher. All the Google postings I checked required a degree. Mods are now censoring comments from people who've said this. I therefore do not recommend Google or Coursera until such time as they're willing to address concerns about online ads for this specialization and the alleged lack of entry-level jobs. ",1
1136,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Andrew T,"May 3, 2021",wish they could make a video of full tutorial on the two given case studies and guide us step by step. they should make it compulsory to submit the project and let other students grade it and give feedback,2
1137,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Nathan W,"Sep 14, 2021","I appreciate the enthusiasm of this course's presenter. However, all the material around the case studies, specifically the first one, leaves a lot to be desired.
To start with, each piece of this material feels like it was written by a different person—and it probably was. This creates a significant problem, in that all the of the material is disjointed and doesn't correctly guide the student through the case study. Sometimes two steps will duplicate a piece of the process, and other times one step will assume something was done earlier when it wasn't. There is an almost complete lack of quality control and editing with respect to stitching together the disparate pieces and making sure that a student can follow them through correctly from start to finish in the order they were presented.
To add a further wrinkle, the first case study specifies in the provided guide that the student should be retrieving the last 12 months of data from the database. However, the R script portion was written when the most recent data was Q1 2020, and it shows. As of the time of writing this (I started the case study at the end of August 2021), the 12 most recent months of data comprised several *million* rows in Excel, and more than a gigabyte of data in total. This amount of data cannot possibly be processed in the free version of RStudio or in a single Excel workbook; it might be doable in SQL, but that requires downloading a SQL platform to work with, since Google didn't see fit to supply us with appropriate access to one (like BigQuery) for the sake of completing this case study.
The course guide should have specified to use the exact same months of data that were used in the R script document for the Analysis phase of the case study. This would allow the student to follow that document from start to finish if there was any confusion about how to code the suggested analysis steps. (As a side note here, why on earth is this script document written in a Google Doc? This makes it practically unreadable. It should be an RMD file that could be followed along with, just like in Course 7.)
All told, the main point of this course turned out to be a disaster when I had really been looking forward to it. I was able to learn quite a bit by trying to troubleshoot all the errors that kept arising, such as the as.numeric() function given in the script document turning my whole ride_length column into NAs, but I learned the most by just trying to clean the data myself before I realized that the case study guide offered specific steps of how to clean and analyze the data. So, thank you, Google, for providing the basics in previous courses so that I could still teach myself something when your case study course turned into a train wreck.",1
1138,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Katelin K,"Jul 17, 2021","I decided not to do the project as it was too unclear, and the datasets were too large. Furthermore, if you chose the R route, you were given the script to use, which seemed too advanced for the amount of R we were taught in the certificate.
I did find the interview videos helpful.",2
1139,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Nick G,"Aug 27, 2021","The previous courses in this program do not adequately prepare students for this project, and there is no help to be found from when things go wrong. I powered through the other seven parts of this without incident, which should have triggered suspicion on my part that the instruction was not enough, but I legitimately thought I was just picking it up that easily.

1140,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Apurv G,"Apr 24, 2021",This Capstone could be better and more guided. Case studies given are either too complicated or have very less data.,2
1141,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Sara S,"Jan 15, 2022","Sadly, a waste of time and money. Too much time was spent on the basics and too little time spent on technical know-how like SQL and R. The videos were boring, the assignments were too few and too pointless, and at the end as I struggled through the case study I realized how ill-prepared I was by this course. To help me finish the case study I started some free Codecademy lessons and learned more there in a few days than this entire course. I thought at least the job board availability at the end of the course would be worth it, but that is a disappointment as well. Unless you live in NYC or Silicon Valley, there is little opportunity to be found there. Perhaps this is a good course for those who need to brush up on their skills, but for true novices it's a big disappointment. ",1
1142,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Adam W,"Aug 21, 2021","I was not expecting too much from this class due to the price, so this review is not based on the content, but rather the flow and presentation.  For a good 60-70% of the course, you are bounced back and forth between Excel commands, SQL commands, testimonials from Google employees, and data analysis best practices.

My notebook looks like 14 people were trying to take notes all at the same time.  Trying to go back through my notes to find one particular command or concept was frustrating.  Once the course starting covering R, it was a little better but still continued to be peppered with extra videos and distractions.  Some of the videos were actually really informative, but how and when they were placed were not helpful to the learning process at all.

Also, having a final/capstone project that is not reviewed or graded devalues the capstone project massively.  I guess you get what you pay for.",3

1146,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Drashya P,"Jun 3, 2021",fake interview video and useless tips very very disappointed with last course,1
1147,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Daniel O,"Jun 30, 2022","Unlike all previous courses within the Data Analytics Certificate, this one is very disappointing. There's a big gap between the skills one can earn throughout the courses and their applicability to the final Capstone project. We have learned general data analytics topics, specific tools, processes, etc. But we were studying them without a chance to look at the big picture - meaning, we were learning every skill in its own sandbox without adding them to the real analytics process. There's no chance to go through the data analysis from start to end similar to the capstone project, but with the supervision of the instructor. Thus, when entering the tasks listed under the capstone, you just don't know what to do. Yes, you know Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, R, and visualization tools, but you don't know where to begin with, how to put everything in order, what you should look at first, second, etc. In other words, there's a definitely missing course or part: a fully guided capstone project. The one in which the instructor(s) guides the learner throughout the project explaining the entire analytic process step by step, allowing learners to make attempts, and providing brief feedback. 
This is why I personally have not completed the Capstone although I marked it as completed. I was simply lost in what I needed to begin with, what was next, and so on. Basically, the Capstone is useless for those who have no previous practical experience.",1
1148,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Karan N,"Apr 22, 2021","Great course overall. Just wish the capstone part was a little more hands-on, and less optional. Helps with accountability. ",3
1149,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Abby R,"Jul 21, 2022","This course soured my entire experience with the rest of the specialization. 
The instruction on the actual case study is lacking at best, abysmal at worst. Even on the guided questions I was lost with very little direction, and the direction I did get seemed like it was for something else entirely.
What they should have done was give you two optional courses, one for the guided case study and one for the free case study. From there it can allow the instructor to go into more depth about what you needed to do. 
What it actually did was give you two modules in the same week, both with vague checklists, and instructions that don't take the actual data you're working with into account.
For example: the bicycle dataset. They give you YEARS worth of data, going all the way back to 2004, and only want you to use about 12 months worth of it. They want you to use google sheets, R studio, or SQL for this. Well google sheets literally cannot handle that amount of data and you will frequently run out of RAM in R Studio UNLESS you upgrade to a full account, because the dataset is just so large.  And uploading it to BigQuery literally required me to upload it to google drive first, and then give it a URI because the files were so massive. But one of the steps REQUIRES you to import it into google sheets. 
The issue is that this course doesn't make you do case studies beforehand, it gives you bits and pieces of each part of a case study before throwing you out into sea and making you put all of it together yourself with no rhyme or reason.  And it doesn't help you can clearly tell that each course was designed by someone different, which I was willing to put up with until this course assumed so much of the past few courses.
Is this course worth it? Yes, you still learn valuable insights on R, Tableau, SQL, Spreadsheets. But don't expect this to be your sole ticket into becoming a data analyst. Manage your expectations before starting.",1

You led me to believe that you had a coalition of potential employers ready to consider new Google Data Analytics Certificate holders. That is one of the main reasons that I signed up for this program. Too bad it was not true. I know that there are plenty of analyst jobs available through the usual job search platforms like Indeed.

Its not that I don't understand, I did well for all previous courses, I did understand and enjoyed. But at this point I think that there is something missing. It should not end up this way.  While studying here I was feeling myself energized by learning, understanding lessons and answering quizzes, because I was doing all my exercise and understanding all lectures and coding until lesson 8. Here I was disappointed and feel deceived. And the reason I guess is very clear. For people like me with basic English knowledge ( I am sure I am not the only one here) There must be a walk through follow along  included in this course showing how you make your profile step by step, putting things together and doing your case study, working with example and follow on applying all the knowledge gained so far and putting them together, not leaving like this. I AM SURE THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS MISSING IN THIS PART OF COURSE.

1169,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Brittany S,"Oct 19, 2021","Overall, I thought this course was really good, especially for the value relative to the cost. 
Coming in, I already had intermediate skills in data analysis, so the first few weeks of the course were a little basic and introductory. I appreciated that there was the option to test out of some of that framework. 
I was really here for the SQL and R sections, which were new skills for me, as well as to improve my skills in Tableau which were very basic. While I found both these sections were great to form an understanding of the core concepts in SQL, R and Tableau, I don't feel as though I retained enough of the more advanced skills in these areas and would need to supplement in order to be proficient at these skills. I'm also more on the business analyst side and am not super interested in the more technical components, so it's fair to say that there may be others who will pick this up during this time. 
I would have rather had the course focus only on SQL, vs including R, so that way users could actually learn more advanced functions in SQL. 
For those just starting out, or for truly building a framework for an entry-level position, I think this course is solid and would highly recommend. But, if you're looking to go a little deeper ",4
1170,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Marcello C,"Mar 3, 2023","Good Introduction into data analytics but did not focus on HARD skills enough to function as a kick-start for a career change. It does great at building a foundation of understanding, but does not provide sufficient information or training on skills necessary to compete in a real-world job hunt. 

My advice for the course creators, a lot of these 4-week courses could be condensed, sped-up, or pruned all-together. The courses are full of video speeches or endorsements from Google employees in the field, and while this is nice for motivation, it doesn't do much to add real value to the course. Instead of bogging the course-work down with so many of these, they could have included more parallels to course-work and real-work that they have done, or skipped over these endorsements completely and dove a bit deeper into the hard skills required. Skills like SQL, Tableau, R, and Python. The course introduced all of these skills well, but failed to provide more than a cursory knowledge of each. 
This final course, the case-study, was given when my confidence in these skills were low. I ended up spending a majority of my time on this final course trying to teach myself the skills necessary to complete the task, the same skills that should have been focused on throughout the course. While I managed to complete the case-study, I still feel like I lack sufficient understanding and ability in these skills to pursue a career change. 
My advice to other students, don't delude yourself into believing this course is enough. Its a great foundation for an introduction to the field, but no where near enough to build the skills necessary to actually work in it. This course felt more like preparing you to pursue education in this field rather than preparing you to work. Myself, I will be exploring these skills further in other courses, and learn Python as well. ",2

1173,Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by Google,Shea S,"Jan 4, 2023","This certificate is helpful only on the most basic of levels. Will you learn appropriate vocabulary and have the most rudimentary understanding of what technical skills are required as a data analyst? Yes. Will you feel confident enough to not only complete a well-informed case study at the end, but also be a competent data analyst? No. 
The first 4 or so courses were fine. The concepts were explained well and examples were provided. But once you hit the Analyze course, it all falls apart. To say that the Analyze certificate needs work would be an understatement. There was too much hand-holding through the basic Excel/Sheets exercises and too little explanation on the SQL analysis. It would make more sense to take more time to explain subqueries and JOINs in SQL than to assume people don't know how the SUM function works in Sheets/Excel. 
Beyond course 5 (Analyze), my expectations dropped dramatically. The certificates ""fluff quantity"" didn't go down when it desperately needed to. The examples continued to be too basic with no real-life, on-the-job nuance and application. When you're actually getting into the processes you'll be performing on a daily basis as a real-life analyst (cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, presenting), there needs to a proportionate amount of explanations, context, and ""why's"" answered.  More hands-on activities/exercises with real-world data sets that need actual cleaning  and walking through the steps to legitimately analyze said data would've helped. 
I don't feel qualified to work in this role after completing this certificate. There was not enough emphasis on the skills and discernment needed to actually do this job. Conversely, there was too much ""grade school fluff"" and the examples and content provided barely scratched the surface for what is necessary to work as a data analyst. 
Also, the capstone project needs supplementation. If you're going to provide ""guidance"" through it, provide supplementary functions or suggested steps to actually do the project. Guiding questions aren't enough when graduates of this certificate only know 3-5 functions in R when you'd need at least 3x that amount to do a proper data cleaning in RStudio. 
Overall, this certificate won't provide you much more than a surface-level understanding of data analysis. Additional courses on Udemy and referencing other case studies on Kaggle taught me more about the practical application of data analysis than this certificate did. ",1

I didn’t know how to start, what files needed to be used, how to import them since they were too big etc. I was looking forward to doing the case study but became quickly discouraged upon reading the case study options. I had to skip it because I couldn’t figure out what to do. I couldn’t find information on what I was supposed to do anywhere or even how to start. And both of the case studies needed to be done in R or SQL because they are too large for spreadsheets and I feel like the courses didn’t teach us how to solve these case studies properly, especially using R it felt like a very rushed and confusing course. Deeply disappointed that this wasn’t clear enough to follow along with. I felt completely blindsided and baffled that I was just thrown into a case study when the course never walked us through how to completely do a project on our own. ",1

The technical part, in turn, is very superficial and teaches the very basic of spreadsheets, SQL, and R. The Capstone project is good practice, but doesn't mean much without some sort of validation of review.",3

I wish they had did a little more hand holding and walked me step by step through a case study using all of the steps we had learned before in the other classes, but all together now at once. Then, we could do another on our own. I had to find examples online and try to read through what they did first before I completely understood what I'm supposed to be doing.

The case study road map was an amazing guide as it took me step by step through the thought processes necessary to complete each phase of the data analysis process.  I completed it as I worked my way through each phase and it kept my focus on the business task.  I was able to utilize the majority of tools that were taught in the courses and was also able to reach out via Google to seek answers to questions that other analysts were also seeking,  It was a wonderful and sometimes exasperating experience to work through code and determine why I received an error but it was great learning.

1261,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Andrew H,"Apr 5, 2018","This course is by far the weakest out of the 5 course sequence. I did well in it (96.8%) but I think the programming exercises did not help build understanding of sequence models. Often I found myself just trying to get through the programming because I felt it was more an exercise in reading Keras documentation. I think you can pass this course without a solid understanding of what is going on in the sequence models. The programming exercises should be revamped to focus more on understanding what is happening in the program rather than trying to figure out Keras syntax (which is also useful, but perhaps better suited for a prep course).",2

As a result the prerecorded classes remain on Coursera to accrue some residual income.  But, Andrew Ng and the staff are apparently gone.
Sadly, since these classes are no longer based on REAL Stanford classes the quality has gone downhill.  I would recommend not taking the deeplearng_ai classes.  Stick to classes offered by currently employed professors at established universities--preferably classes that ARE the same as the university classes or, at least, those derived from actual classes.",1

However, I feel that I have learned less during this course comparing to the other ones in the specialization. First, I believe it was an extensive use of Keras. Whereas the framework is great, it would be much better for understanding if all the exercises were in numpy, whereas Keras tween-projects be optional.  Doing both numpy and Keras versions would allow to better understand the material and learn through repetition. Second, even though the course is great, I perceived the number of errors/typos was much higher than in other courses. Is that true? For example, the Jazz Improvisation exercise was a nightmare.

I spent countless hours trapped, not able to perform the most basic of operations, such as saving my work or submitting. I lost work innumerable times. I, like others, eventually resorted to ""saving"" my work by copying it into a text editor on my system for fear of Jupyter sabotaging me. Even if the system was stable, most of the assignments were worthless as learning experiences. The majority of ""programming"" boiled down to playing a cryptic game of fill in the blank.

1266,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Anand R,"May 7, 2018","To set the context, I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.
This course is the 5th and final one in a 5 part series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning on coursera. I believe it is useful to take this course in order and it makes sense to study it as a part of the series, though technically that is not necessary.
This is one of the best courses to take if you want to understand the basics of Sequence Models (Recurrent Neural Networks). RNN is a technically-difficult-to-understand, still-evolving field of Neural Networks, and it has thus far found remarkable uses in a wide variety of field, ranging from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Voice-to-Text conversion and Music Synthsis, to name a few. Dr. Ng really exposes us to this cutting edge research, by explaining research papers that were only recently published. By now, I could see how the problems would be tackled.  However, there are several subtle aspects, such as the optimal metrics to use, the clever modification in the NN architecture, etc. which Dr. Ng drew attention to and made clear.
The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intuition using analogies and real-life examples. The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well. As with the other courses, the programming exercises are the best part of the course. You get to practice, (1) Music synthesis, (2) NLP and Sentiment Analysis, (3) Trigger Word Detection (Hello Google, Hey Siri, Alexa!), ... All these problems are actual, real-life projects, which are extremely difficult to solve. They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school.
Overall, this is an excellent course. Thank you Dr Ng and the teaching assistants, Thank you coursera.

""Sequence Models"" course is *disappointing*. It leaves you with bunch of scratches on the surface of technology without any details and/or understanding of how technology works. In simple words, it is not the course, it is bad overview of just few technologies. In order to get similar comprehension of technologies delivered in first four courses of this specialization you will need to spend a lot more time digging for information elsewhere.
Same issue with homework assignments. They are a bit helpful for technology understanding to some small extent, but they do lack depth.
Whole ""Sequence Model"" course looks like compromised/failed attempt to explain fairly complex material to newcomers. As a result, newcomers won't understand anything due to complexity of the matter, experienced engineers won't take away anything due to simplified explanations and absence of details.

To the contents: the course covers many uses of sequence models, for many different formats (many-to-one, many-to-many...), the questionnaires are focused but comprehensive and the programming exercises cover a wide range of difficulty levels, from no-brainer-one-liners (most of them) to implementing LSTM backprop by hand (optional). They take away the dirty work from you but make sure you get how you would do it. At the end you get to work with pretty complex setups like the attention model, but you still get the feeling of knowing how it ticks from the very bottom up.
The actual merit is that, even if it feels simple, it actually does work and is a takeaway knowledge that can be directly applied for personal setups. And mr Ng's videos are a charm, you can totally feel the care. Glad to see him back after so many years :)

Unfortunately, this is the weakest one among the whole specialization. There are no deep explanation of LSTM as well as GRU and back-propagation algorithm. Seq2seq models explanation is not clear and looks too inconsistent. I had to read a lot of the additional materials and blogs in order to understood a theory behind lectures. Hence, the first week assignments were disagreeably difficult to complete, whereas second and third week assignments were comparatively easy. I think this course should be revised or prolonged for 4 weeks to cover LSTM models more profoundly.

I hoped that I would be able to program my own models after finishing this course but I have to admit I can't. It is not very helpful to follow coding instructions line by line without knowing WHY it should be done this way.

The bad: Everything else, I wouldn´t recommend this course. The quizzes are labs are very buggy. Labs are boring and very rigid (maybe because of coursera's platform?), I don't see the point of keeping testing (through all 5 courses in the specialization) if the student is capable of replacing a None in a variable declaration or a loop, while the whole preprocessing of the data is done automatically. Also, I found out that the last lab was literally taken from the tensor flow examples page and they just changed some variable names or replaced variable values with None. The change of paradigm in the last lab is also hard to understand. It seems they needed to ""fill in"" some content in order to ""update"" the course, I felt very dissapointed since transformers was something I was looking forward to learn.
After 5 courses the classes become very tedious, and the way Andrew present seems very old-fashion for a topic in the technology field. I mean, there's more appealing ways to teach computer/data science than with power point slides while writing on top of them.

The last transformer exercise left me stunned though in how bad it was. When I understood something it contained obvious mathematical inconsistencies. It was the first time I needed the forum help, which is outside the coursera website and they force you to sign up in addition to coursera. 
The tutor reacted fast but extremely patronising, going so far as pretending mistakes in the exercise didn't exist, but very eager to blame me for using an outdated version, that I wasn't using.

I understand that the course is intended for the broad audience but will one be able to implement those Keras and TensorFlow algorithms on a moderately complex problem, which is the ultimate goal of these courses?

I did already the NLP Specialization of DeepLearning.AI and wanted to learn more about the inner workings of neural nets and I was not a single minute disappointed by my decision! Extremely well done overall! In particular the course on Sequence models is very enjoyable and will give you all the tools and intuition necessary to understand the background and the basis of such models and how they work! You even have a last week on Attention-based models, which is a little bit introductory, given that Attention as a concept exploded after this course was developed. Nevertheless, it is very well executed! My only critique is that, the whole specialization was developed before TensorFlow 2.0, and later on it the assignments were ported and Keras is used. But during the lectures on will not find any introduction to Keras and all this content is left for the assignments. This requires from the student more effort to understand and use Keras. What can be a bit frustrating, because Keras API also evolved during this time. I would suggest adding a couple of videos or ungraded labs in order to teach the student a bit better how to use the framework. But well, this is a minor issue. 5 Stars are for the overall amazing presentation of what is indeed important, the Deep Learning fundamentals. Moreover, Andrews last video is just very much aspiring and a powerful message that everyone in the field should come in contact with! Congrats! I hope the team plan to execute soon an updated version of the specialization in order to incorporate the new advances and to adapt it to the newest DL Framework. Apart from that the theory videos are 5 out of 5. Clear recommendation!",5
1326,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Alejandro A,"Apr 15, 2018","A year ago I was basically ""on blank"" in regards of Machine Learning.
I've started ""my journey"" on ML about 9 months ago, with a text book I've got on Amazon called ""Data Mining, Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques"", Self taught I've read, transcribed, done some math, covered the half of it. But I needed something more practical to speed up, so I've tried also with the coursesfrom ""Super Data Science""'s team on Udemy, but found them to be too focused on practice rather than deep reasoning of it (I might be wrong but that's the impression I had); So I needed more formal, University-like.
I've decided to try out Andrew's first course on Machine Learning (with Matlab), which gave me much greater view and understanding, had my head melting specially on weeks 4-6, but after finishing the course I've felt I did finally know what ML was! but still there was ""a lot missing"", given the course was already a bit old, and the technology had developed greatly since then.
Fortunately to me, I've found out about this specialisation right after I've finished the first course and I've signed up immediately. Today (14.4.2018) I've finished the second specialisation. After 6 months of continuos dedication, doing the first 3 month course, plus this 3 month specialisation.
Homeworks in Matlab and Python were my next challenge, even I'm a developer for 15 years (C# / Java, C). Combining a lot of new theory in a new language made it harder but also satisfying.
I'm the kind of person that needs to understand why things work as they work, that might be my weakness but also my strength; It's not enough for me to drive the car, but I need to know how to tune it. I must tell that for example, a video/lecture of 15 minutes meant to me usually 60 minutes of work, transcribing, doing the math, etc. That made my 6 months particularly long..",5
1327,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Artem B,"Nov 21, 2018","This is again a fantastic course and what a nice way to finish the Deep Learning Specialization. It is certainly the most difficult one from the whole specialization and has taken me a lot longer than I planned. This is partially due to the fact that focus is shifted a bit more towards the programming assignments and concepts that are only briefly mentioned in the lectures turn out to be crucial for the assignments. The forum helps a lot, without it I would not have  been able to crack the first week, especially the optional parts of the assignments. There were also a few errors in derivation formulas, that had set me back, but in the end I understood the concepts a lot better and found some nice complementary resources online. And the RNNs are more complex and seem more variable than other network architectures, so that is ok that this course is more difficult. Now I feel that I finally have a good grasp of Deep Learning concepts and have a nice set of skills. And the assignments are super fun and very useful. Thank you Andrew Ng and your team for making such a wonderful content. I teach at the university-level and I can only imagine how much effort goes into preparing such a course and at such a high level of expertise. I encourage everyone to take this specialization, this specialization is the main gem in Coursera, in my opinion.  ",5
1328,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,John Y,"Mar 15, 2018","It is apparent how much thought and effort has been put into creating these courses.  Dr. Ng introduces you to state-of-the-art CNN and Sequence models which are quite complex.  But he expertly presents it to you so that you can focus on the essential aspects and not the details.  In courses 1-3, you might feel like you're being spoon-fed in the assignments but it is really a great approach to ease you into the deep learning field.  In courses 4 and 5, there is less guidance so that you can become more independent and be able to figure things out on your own.  After all, this is how it will be in our future jobs - no more TA's then.  
One thing I really appreciated in this specialization was the use of good notation.  For me this was very important because it made it easier to apply theory into practice (via the assignments).  Another thing is the amazing selection CNN and sequence model topics that were covered.  Because of this, I now have a good idea where to focus my future projects/work.  I also loved the assignments because they helped me understand the concepts much better.       
For future students, please note that there are mini tutorials for Python (in Course 1), TensorFlow (in Course 2), and Keras (in Course 4).  Keras is used a lot in Course 5 but there is no Keras tutorial in that course.         ",5
1329,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Damon L,"May 15, 2021","From my perspective as a learner, there're two biggest""disaster"" they may encounter:
1. A boring lesson to take.
2. Tuns of confusing question hanging in mind with no way out. 
Coursera prevents those two biggest obstacles of learning from happening. Here's my experience:
1. During taking the DLS Courses lessons, I burst to laugh more than some times. 
The laugh comes from the joy of meeting something interesting, from the surprise of finding something very powerful, from the happiness of mastering something that can create everything, which is like a pencil to draw the boundaryless dreamy beauty world, a piano to compose infinite wonderful music, a magic to perform the impossible miracle.
2. The discourse forum is turning the potential disaster of questions into the joy of exploring and gain of problem solving.
First, mentors response questions fast. 
Second, they analyze questions very patiently and carefully, no matter it seems big or small. 
Last but not the least, they encourage a lot, which cultivates a free environment to ask, to explore, to experiment, and to share.
Here I give all my credit to the lesson team and the discourse team, they're the best dancing partner to each other. And now we learners are joining this wonderful dancing floor! There surely is lots of joy and gain.",5
1330,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Maksym P,"Jan 27, 2021","I really enjoyed the course. As usually Andrew and his team of dedicated professionals did a wonderful job of explaining an otherwise very hard material in an accessible way. The distinction of Andrew's classes is that they really give the *intuition* about why a particular approach works. Sure I may forget which particular regularization methods exist, but I will remember *why* and *when* to use regularization. The details can be always looked up elsewhere.
I can't imagine how much effort it took to create high quality slides, transcripts and WELL-DOCUMENTED CODE(!) in the notebooks. Being a software engineer, I can't stress the importance of a good documentation enough.
Since the notebooks already propose a well-designed NN architecture which gets the job done, what I'd like to see is maybe some reasoning about why *this* particular design was chosen, and not some other one.  There are some explanations already, but even more explanations would not hurt :)

I strongly recommend this specialization for anyone who wish get their hands dirty and  wants to understand what really happens under the hood of Neural networks with some curiosity.
Some of the key factors that differentiate this specialization from other specialization course: 
1. Concepts are laid from ground up (i.e you to got to build models using basic numpy/pandas/python and then all the way up using tensorflow and keras etc)

This Deep Learning Specialization was fantastic!! I feel more proud after completing this than I did after finishing the CPA exam!
I took Professor Ng's Machine Learning course as a prerequisite, which I would recommend to everyone before diving into the Deep Learning Specialization. The switch from Octave to Python can be a little tricky, but stick with it. Octave allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the Linear Algebra aspects and matrix multiplication than Python does (for me it did anyway).
The entire line up of courses prepares you so well to develop an eye for deep learning use cases and gives you the skills necessary to dive in and start applying deep learning solutions to real world scenarios.

1335,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Teresa,"May 15, 2020","     In the beginning, I found the instructor a little difficult to understand, even though he is very good at explaining complicated concepts simply.  I am sure part of the reason is that I was unfamiliar with the technical terms.  Once I switched on the captioning option, my comprehension improved however I noticed an average of at least one translation error per video and these seemed to be caused by the instructor's accent and were sometimes very interesting errors.  So, I guess the system could use a little more training with the specific AI vocabulary and/or adjusting the context error settings for the subject matter.
     However, once I had the captioning on, it was harder to follow the notes because sometimes the important information was right under the captions.  What was really helpful was when he summarized with typed versions for two reasons.  One, it was clearer to read and understand.  Second, it was higher on the screen and did not overlap with the captioning.",5

Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.

- Courses don't teach enough Keras & Tensorflow syntax to be completely stand-alone.  If you take this course, you won't really be able to build your own DNN's unless you also take a separate Keras / Tensorflow course.
- Links to Keras documentation are broken -- they now take you to the general Keras homepage, not the specific command's page.
- In later courses, Andrew Ng's lectures are not edited.  Starting around the 4th course, you start hearing Dr. Ng stop and repeat portions of the lecture, presumably intending the first attempt to be edited out in the future.  Usually this is easy to ignore, but in some cases he repeats 30-60 seconds of lecture, which can be confusing.
- In the last course (sequence models), the text captions of Dr. Ng's lecture have a lot of mistakes, which is a little ironic for a course on speech-to-text ",5

Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.

Prof. Andrew doesn’t just tell you the name of a function for a library (like scikit
learn or tensorflow) and give you magic numbers for parameters. You actually build the model yourself and learn what the parameters stand for and what is the purpose of those parameters and hyper-parameters.
The specialization is well divided into meaningful courses and each course is well structured so that you know exactly what you are going to learn and what key specific skills you will get after completion of a course.

Thanks for the possibility to learn deep learning with Python. I am curious whether Julia, that is a kind of mixture of Python and MATLAB with parallel computing, will gain popularity.

I get the dynamic aspect of writing the lecture notes in the videos, however the lecture notes should be ""cleaned up"" in the downloadable files (i.e., typos corrected and typed up).

One feedback: I wish there was a week dedicated to doing just backprop and gradient computations for plain RNNs as well as LSTM-cell based RNNs. The latter is covered to some degree in the programming assignment as an ungraded part, but I don't think that is enough justice to the topic.

Also, another feedback: sometimes keeping track of the dimensions of the various entities in play was very difficult for me. Perhaps 10-15 minutes dedicated to explaining just that would be helpful to students.

Now, I can start thinking of the vast potential for using Deep Neural Networks not only in Research and Space Sciences, where my interests are, but also in my daily life. Very many thanks again!

1348,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Maurice M,"Jun 9, 2020","The whole series was excellent but in particular this last course on RNNs. Thank you for not skipping the mathematical details and letting us figure out backpropagations through time and how Adam works under the hood and explaining LSTMs and Attention so well. There was even a notebook on Attention! And the dinosaurus notebook was cool but the jazz improvisation really blew me away: the music actually sounded really nice! :) Also, thank you for pre-training the models to safe us time and teach us how to resume training from learned weights! The quizzes were helpful in developing an intuition and the price point was more than fair. Perfect series, Andrew, thanks a lot!
Best, Maurice",5
1349,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Stephen M,"Nov 10, 2020","Another excellent course, well presented, with compelling content.  My only concerns are regarding the labs.   With no previous Python or Keras experience, I found I needed to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on new programming domains in order to complete the assignments (my previous experience is mainly C).   While this was somewhat an issue in the previous courses in the Specialization, I found it particularly so in Sequence Models.  This distracted from the main objective of understanding the core NN algorithms.   I would recommend either: 1) advising students to have a solid background in Python, or 2) a bit more clarity on how to use the Keras functions in the labs.",5
1350,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Francis S,"Aug 26, 2019","Previously, I have taken online classes before in Machine Learning by going the cheap route (Udemy, blogs, youtube) and you get what you pay for. Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!",5
1351,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Hermes R S A,"Apr 18, 2018","A very good course. It presented gated units like GRU and LSTM with so much simplicity that anyone can understand it on the first run. The downsides were the Jazz music generation, since it was the only task where the data is non intuitive (MIDI files) so you black-box apply the algorithm to a data you have no idea how it is structured, unless, of course, you are familiar with MIDI files prior to this course. Other than that, the learning curve was a bit slower in the beginning, but explodes by the end of the course, where you put all the subjects you've learned to perform a neural machine translation, which, in my opinion, was hugely awesome and rewarding.",5
1352,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Dipan M,"Jul 15, 2018","Like all other course in this specialization, this is also indeed a great course. It fundamentally clears concepts and gives very clear concpts for topics such as RNN and LSTM, which can ohterwise can be difficult to digest. Also, the programming excersices, built on great topics, suh as Music synthesis, Trigger word activation, are exciting to work on. The only feedback I would like to suggest, is that topics of Backpropogation for sequence model is critical and should have been taken up indepth in study rather than left to excerciss only. Overall this course is more fast paced and packed 3 weeks which should have been perhaps a 4 week course.",5
1353,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Shuvayan G D,"Jun 30, 2019","This course teaches in-depth knowledge of sequence models in natural language processing and speech regocnition . The programming excercises and the quizzes provide more content to furthur your grasp on the matter . The progamming exercises being totally in Keras , provides a clear analogy of how LSTM s and GRU s , work along with attention models introduced in the last week. You also have to implement  a LSTM and RNN from scratch in Numpy , which provides for the basic knowledge how these architectures actually work. Overall , it was a great experience and taking this course should be a pre-requisite for all learning in NLP. ",5
1354,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Jeffrey S,"Apr 28, 2018",Whew! This was very interesting and challenging. I have a huge backlog of things I need to go back and read up on and better understand. I really appreciate the work that Andrew and his team put into these courses.  The lectures were very well paced and clear. His temperament is exemplary for a teacher and his subject knowledge comes across.  I found the exercises really well thought out and beautifully crafted. The coding style could not have been more clear and the consistency made it understandable despite the complexity of the subject and the limited time to delve into the mechanics of Keras and the Python tools. Bravo!,5
1355,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Matthew J C,"Mar 28, 2018","The last course is in this series does not disappoint. I found this course to be more difficult than the others; likely because I had very little prior exposure to recurrent neural networks. However, this course is worth the effort as it opens up a realm of new possibilities; text, audio & time-series data. Whether you need to detect, classify or translate sequences, or even generate new sequences in the vein of some examples, this course is for you. There are several high-level APIs for performing these tasks but having a deeper understanding of what these APIs are doing is invaluable to your success. Take this course.",5
1356,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Ricardo S,"Mar 4, 2018","An extremely well thought off and comprehensive introduction to sequence models, with examples taken from the most important/interesting application domains. Andrew NG's clarity of exposition is absolutely wonderful on such an otherwise complex area. The assignments are very cleverly chosen and helped me to finally get to grips with Keras. This being a new course, the assignment notebooks had a few minor issues that are well known by now and documented in forums and erratas, and will likely be fixed in subsequent reruns. Nevertheless, given the breadth and quality of the content, 5 starts are absolutely well deserved.",5
1357,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Mehran M,"Jul 22, 2018","This was, in my opinion, the best of the 5 courses. Actually, here's how I'd rank the courses (from best to worse): 
5, 1, 2, 3, 4
I learned a lot about sequence models and half-way through the course, I was able to jump right in and try some ideas I had in PyTorch.
The assignments could use a bit more work: I didn't really feel inspired by them and their ""fill in the blank"" style prevented me from thinking too hard.
All in all, I highly recommend this entire specialization. I was completely clueless about deep learning at the beginning, but now I'm actually trying out some novel ideas!
Thanks so much Andrew and the team.",5
1358,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Rahul K,"Mar 20, 2018","This course, undoubtedly, has the toughest assignments compared to all the previous courses. The content is rich and informative. Again, pay close attention to the hints given in the programming exercises. If you don't follow, check the Discussion Forums to get a hint. Professor Andrew, your teaching is absolutely sublime - Crisp and concise. Personally, I would have loved an entire week dedicated to Attention Models as the entire concept seemed a bit rushed. Other than that, I have absolutely no qualms! For the people who are enrolling for THIS course only - make sure you're pretty good with Python and Keras.",5
1359,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,David R R,"Feb 20, 2018","Such a great course. It explains everything from scratch and teach you how to code in numpy (scratch) and how to code in keras to build high performance system (instead of tiny datasets).
I recommend this corse and the DeepLearning specialization as well. Thank you.
Es un curso muy bueno. En el se explica todo desde cero y te enseña como programar los modelos en Numpy (desde cero) o usando keras para crear modelos de alto rendimiento (a pesar de los datasets pequeños por falta de capacidad de computo).
Recomiendo este curso a todo el mundo asi como tambien las especializacion completa en DeepLearning. Gracias",5
1360,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Chan-Se-Yeun,"May 1, 2018","This a the last and the most anticipated course for me. It's hard, informative and most useful. I've got chance to learn some popular and powerful methods within the years, like word embedding and attention mechanism. I start to understand the way deep learning community deal with NLP, i.e., ingenious design of network structure inspired by the pattern human beings perceive the world. It doesn't enjoy solid foundation as statistical learning does, but is works and suitable for engineering. That's astonishing! I hope I can combine deep learning with traditional methods to better understand NLP.",5
1361,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Boyko T,"Sep 15, 2020","I just want to say Thanks to Andrew and the team for a great content. I may not be able to create award winning NLP models after this course, but I have learned a bunch about them. Lots of work went into creating great videos and even more in creating the programming projects. I really appreciate the format of the programming assignments. For someone with not much experience in DL, they were pretty close to perfect: I felt I was not left to fend for myself, yet they were not overly simple and forced me to solidify what was thought in the lectures and learn better. Thank You Andrew and team!",5
1362,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Hu H,"Jan 3, 2019","Thanks very much for Andrew Ng and the other teachers, who made a series of these awesome classes including  videos or programming works running on the jupyter-notebook. And also thanks the finical aid provided by the Coursera, I can't finished this course without your generous help. After a hard work with  the Deep Learning classes, not only gained the knowledges, but inspired by the spirt from Andrew that ""try to help people with your technology"", which actually changed my mind, I will study more, do better to remember that in my life. Thank you and hope the world be a better place.",5
1363,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Adarsh K,"Jan 20, 2020","Awesome Course! Learned a lot. Would highly recommend this to anyone willing to learn NLP, Sequence Modelling, Word Embeddings, Machine Translation and related stuff. The course builds from fundamentals of NLP like RNNs then LSTMs/GRUs to Word Representations to Sequence-to-Sequence Modelling. At the end you'd learn so much that by just looking at a single slide of an overview of Trigger Word Detection you could make the entire DL model yourself. You'd be fluent with Keras after completing this course. I'd like to thank the Instructor, the Teaching Assistants and the mentors.",5
1364,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Willard C T,"Jul 1, 2020","I have taken now 6 or 7 courses conducted by Andrew Ng, including this series of 5, and it is absolutely amazing to me that a person of his eminence & level of achievements would even take the time to offer courses like this series. And, what makes it still more incredible is his sincerity, humility and genuine enthusiasm for the subject matter and his gift for explaining it, especially when it becomes very complex. It is just so inspiring; he is truly a rare & exceptional person & teacher and I look forward to taking whatever other courses he is conducting or recommending.",5
1365,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,xuezhibo,"Feb 20, 2019","The last course is a little bit more difficult than the previous! Although I majored in Civil Engineering and got my Master's degree in 2018, since I finished the Machine Learning class of Ng 2 months ago,I found this art is so charming and powerful ,so I continued to finish the CS229, That is also a wonderful course!! And today,this DL course was also completed, now I am attending the CS231N class~  Thank you Ng ,thank u cousera, because of you,I have a chance to attend those amazing course from the most famous university.

1366,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Adi,"Feb 12, 2020","Amazing course. This course was very informative. The assignments gives students the ability to code in keras and use those NLP models described in lectures in the programming assignments.
I felt there was enough help during the programming assignments from the instructors /mentors on the discussion board. 
The only thing I wish about this course is to let the students program the Data science part of the programming assignment. I felt some of the details of the pre-processing of the data was already done. It would have been nice to do that or add as an optional part.",5
1367,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Solomon W,"Feb 12, 2018","Very frustrating grader. Really time wasting. What is this team trying to accomplish with such disorganized efforts? I hope to see more improvements in the future. I have just completed week1's assignments and revising my reviews from 1 to 4 because the course content is really good and has softened the disappointments caused by the grader. 
After week1, the grader frustrations eased as it was working more and more consistently. Most importantly, I learned lots of cool stuff and so I am revising my reviews from 4 to 5. I hope all grader issues are now resolved.",5
1368,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Srikumar K S,"Jun 4, 2022","Superb instruction mode that strikes a good balance between the nitty gritties of working with language data and actual model building. The only disappointing bit about the latter parts of this ""sequence models"" course was that the models (esply the transformer models) are too time consuming to train in the context of a programming assignment and so we used pretrained models to check results. This was a bit of a let down (albeit justifiable) since the satisfaction of seeing the transformer model we coded perform still seemed far away (also understandably).",5
1369,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Florent G,"Jun 8, 2019","A huge thanks for this journey in the specialisation. The material is of high quality and the pedagogie of high qualiber! My only regret is that the course is not longer :P I would have love a course about GAN for example. Also an advanced followup on this specialisation would be amazing. Wanting to learn more i will probably continue my path with https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893?referrer=nvidia&utm_source=nvidia&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=referrerpage, however i would love to continue with deeplearning.ai !

1370,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Jianxu S,"Jun 19, 2020","With time and perseverance, most of us are able to complete this final course of a rather challenging specialization. I particularly like the final course because the programming assignments combine architectures and techniques we learned in previous courses/weeks including CNN, RNN, GRU, Attention, LSTM, just to name a few. We also repeatedly write codes in Keras which give us a lot of practice and without being bogged down to every little detail. Big thanks to Andrew and team for making this specialization available to world's deep learning community.",5
1371,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Jing L,"Sep 7, 2023","You can learn deep learning from scratch, learning the detailed mechanics of and implementing forward pass and back propagation of MLP, CNN, RNN and LSTM using numpy. You will also learning a lot of useful tricks in practice here and there. That's exactly what I am looking for, as I don't want to just use a NN framework like a black box. You also get to learn a good part of the functional API of TensorFlow (the sequential API is much more obvious). You also get a lot of exposure to many diverse typical applications, which is very eye-opening.",5

You learn of the latest state of the art techniques of developing sequence models using techniques such as GRU's, LSTM's, how to debug them and also how to employ Attention models to make your models that much efficient for problems in NLP, Machine Translation and Speech Recognition. This course is a must for anyone who wants to be a sound practitioner of AI. I love it.",5
1374,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Sikang B,"Apr 2, 2018","Though there are some minor lost clarifications in the flow, the general learning experience of this course is overwhelmingly practical and relevant to many real world scenarios. Personally felt this course completed the knowledge graph (of course I only have a preliminary understanding of everything) and opens many doors for future learning.
One nit-pick is Keras documentation can be annoying confusing and misleading at times. Would suggest to revise programming assignment instructions based on some popular threads in Forum discussions.",5
1375,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Aleš D,"Mar 4, 2018","As usual, Andrew makes AI almost look easy. I have one comment about programming exercises. There are errors in the text sometimes and, at least personally, I don't have a habit to check discussion forums first, before starting work on the assignment so these things were sometimes a source of lost time, scratching my head where have I gone wrong only to find that the results are correct and it was the notebook that was not up to date.
This aside, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in AI. Keep up the good work!",5
1376,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Ali S,"Jan 6, 2019","Finally, I understood LSTMs, thanks to this course, thanks to Andrew! Before this course, I spent many hours reading papers on LSTMs and trying to figure out what is going on with all these ""Gates"", but couldn't understand intuitions behind them. In this course not only I learned and understood them, but also I learned a lot about machine translation and speech recognition which I was frightened to approach them. This course gave me all fundamental concepts and tools that I needed to be able to deal with sequential data.",5
1377,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Alina P,"Nov 23, 2018","Completed Deep Learning specialization in the DeepLearning.ie. I really liked this course, it will be useful not only for the beginners, but also for the specialists, which want to have an overview about current neural networks trends and see the interview from the best specialists of AI. To make this course perfect I would recommend to fix some errors in the theory of programming assignments (specially in the last 2 courses). Sometimes this issues are confusing and forcing to check on the forums correctness of the task.",5
1378,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Roni M,"Apr 23, 2020","The material was interesting and very clear (like previous courses in this specialisation)
I think due to the complexity and nature of these subject, it's hard to grasp it all based on this programming assignment because in each exercise I was only able to implement a fraction of the ""big picture"". It would be very helpful to have a kind of ""running"" assignment, in which you start with an actual blank slate, and build all the building blocks from scratch so I can have much better understanding of the bigger picture.",5

Programming practices are so good that everyone can see the designers must have put tons of hours to prepare for learners. Especially all the steps about the GRU, LSTM, Attention and etc are listed very clearly with no confusion.

Obviously the team put a tremendous effort on the programming exercises to make them doable for laymen yet not trivial. The exercises avoid using libraries (like Keras and TensorFlow) at the very beginning. Instead, they started with the more basic Numpy implementations. After these practice, I am able to grasp what each layer is actually doing. 
My only suggestion is to correct some trivial typos in the Notebook.",5
1382,Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Marc S O,"Sep 13, 2020","I like how it injects the idea of a subjective language/audio processing into a mathematical model learned by a computer. The whole team managing this class has been very careful in setting up the quizzes and machine problems to let the students get their hands dirty on machine learning projects. I gave 5 stars because it encourages people to read research papers, tells if a particular paper is hard to read, recommends papers that are easy to read. This way, more people can be interested in the world of research.",5

The courses is scheduled for three weeks, but is actually doable in an afternoon + a morning session if you have some python programming skills and enjoy 2x on your lectures. My one complaint is not with the course itself but the whole series. I mislike the subscription model for payments. I prefer a one time payment for life-time access.",5
1385,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,divya p p,"Feb 18, 2019","Dear Instructors, 
This is most frustrating course in all of your courses so far. The instructions were completely misguiding the candidates from YOLO implementation onwards. All along you presented the course very well. But when come to most important topics, we had to focus on syntactical errors. But we are supposed to spend time on understanding the algorithms at this level. Dont know why this 180 degrees turn taken by you. If you intentionally designed this course then fine. Otherwise, you should seriously think about rework on the instructions. Few links to hints were taking to some pages in github with just folders.
I am sure , many learners here have such same opinion. I can see this in the forum postings.
From YOLO onwards, you were not giving the big picture of the task. This is confusing. We are lost, where we are heading by the mid of the assignment.
With all due respect to your highly precious time, I request you to enhance the assignment instructions.
All motivation I got from previous course, losing because of this course.
Personally, I feel YOLO easy to understand, but instructions were misguiding and confusing the candidates.
This is my honest feedback, as I very much like this course. I am going forward for the 5th course in this series.
Last but not least. Thank you for making this high quality knowledge made available for public with easy access via Coursera.",3

1389,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Faki Z,"Apr 18, 2019",Great lectures but the programming assignments feel as if it is testing your proficiency with tensorflow which is neither formally covered in the lecture nor the most intuitive framework to understand so you'll spend so much time digging through convoluted tensorflow documents and qna and whatnot to debug your codes that you would rather learn tensorflow formally first and then take this course and still end up finishing it faster than only going through this course only but it is only the programming assignments that basically assume that you are already familiar with the tensorflow framework so if you are only going to go over the video lectures it gives a great overview of how CNN works and many useful algorithms which can applied to a assortment of situations,3

1396,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Anand R,"Apr 3, 2018","To set the context, I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.
This course is the 4th in a 5 part series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning on coursera. I believe it is useful to take this course in order and it makes sense to study it as a part of the series, though technically that is not necessary.
This is one of the best courses to take if you want to understand the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks.  CNN is a technically-difficult-to-understand, still-evolving field of Neural Networks, and it has thus far found remarkable uses in the field of computer vision.  Dr. Ng really exposes us to this cutting edge research, by explaining research papers, starting from its 'inception' to work that was published just two years ago. There are several aspects of CNNs that are difficult to understand, including the very basic ""convolution"" itself.  Much of that is made clear in his video lectures, which explore (and explain) a wide variety of Network Architectures in good detail.  
The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intution using analogies and real-life examples. The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well. As with the other courses, the programming exercises are the best part of the course. You get to practice, (1) decoding hand signs, (2) face verification, (3) face recognition, (4) single and multiple object detection (of cars in a street) ... All these problems are actual, real-life projects, which are extremely difficult to solve.  They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school. 
Overall, this is an excellent course. Thank you Dr Ng and the teaching assistants, Thank you coursera.",5
1397,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,David B C S,"Dec 17, 2018","Great course, easy to understand and very useful. The explanations are very clear, as is expected from the professor. The purpose of the course is for you to have a practical comprehension of CNNs, it will give you the necessary tools to implement you own networks, but it will not get into the specifics of each model. Nevertheless, all of the resources are referenced, which makes it very easy for you to dig deeper on any specific topic covered on the course.",5

1399,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Md. Z M,"Jul 10, 2020","This is the hardest course so far in the Specialization. I don't know whether it's me who is lacking the knowledge to fully comprehend the material, or it is because the material wasn't presented well enough. The experience was quite frustrating, and lost the motivation that I had been carrying through the previous 3 courses.
I appreciate Andrew's efforts in delivering the lectures with the aim to present most complex materials as intuitively as possible, but still I feel, because of the complexity involved with CNNs, the material need more explanations, and maybe extending the course duration to 6 weeks will provide more opportunity to the instructors to present the matter more clearly.
Quite remarkably, the programming exercises fell short on my expectation. It was not useful more than just a simple syntax-check exercise for TensorFlow/Keras/Python. It gives a false sense of achievement, when, in fact, I feel myself far from learning the theoretical underpinnings of the various algorithms explained throughout the course.
To conclude, by completing the course, I believe that you surely would get to know the vocabulary used in CNNs and would be aware of the algorithms developed in the domain, but you won't learn enough to implement these algorithms from scratch yourself.",2

The content is very rough, the videos contained embarrassing outtakes for several lessons now. If you noticed Andre Ng repeat himself or the video go to black, those are not streaming glitches--those are actually in the content you are paying for.

This specialization helped me overall to gain a solid fundamentals and strong intuition about building blocks of Neural Networks. I'm looking forward to have a next level course on top of this track. Thanks again, Sir!
I strongly recommend this specialization for anyone who wish get their hands dirty and  wants to understand what really happens under the hood of Neural networks with some curiosity.
Some of the key factors that differentiate this specialization from other specialization course: 
1. Concepts are laid from ground up (i.e you to got to build models using basic numpy/pandas/python and then all the way up using tensorflow and keras etc) 
2. Programming Assignments at end of each week on every course. 
3. Reference to influential research papers on each topics and guidance provided to study those articles. 
4. Motivation talks from few great leaders and scientist from Deep Learning field/community.",5

There is serious lack of rigor and while it is exciting to see things work , there is very little science to give us a methodical reason of why it works .  In  ConvNet we see the input data, a multi dimensional matrix get reduced in size using filtering and convolution operation  techniques.   From a mathematical point of view, this  is clear and can be formalized but it is not clear why this process causes the ability to identify edges in a picture and evolve as we go deeper into the convNN to the real picture etc...  
It seems to me this more like an alchemy rather then a rigorous scientific approach and this is why it was difficult to follow the exercises from the material of the course  .   I have to put concerted efforts to understand the literature which itself was not easy as it lacked rigorous mathematical and scientific approach ( why we have to increase the channels by multiples as we go deep into the conVNN ? etc...)  .

The instructor makes the material understandable while not straying away from going into the mathematics behind CNNs. This course also starts to get into some of the really cool applications of AI/ML/DL (such as facial recognition and neural style transfer). I also enjoy how this course (and the rest of the courses in the specialization) keeps a great balance between theory and application. It covers enough of the application (techniques and programming) that you could reasonably start working on a computer vision project straight out of the course, however, it still covers much of the theoretical and in-depth knowledge that you may need to know. The main problem I have with other CS MOOCs is that I sometimes feel that they either only focus on the theory or they only focus on the application (programming and engineering). In the former, you understand many of the in-depth concepts but still need to do a decent amount of learning on your own before you can start making stuff, and with the ladder, while you may have the programming knowledge to know how to program an application, you don't really understand the concepts so you have trouble solving a wide range of problems. For the most part, this course and this specialization straddle the line pretty well. It mainly focuses on the concepts but gives you enough practice that you could start on an application.

Inevitably, due to the complexity of CNN, we have to rely on frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras, etc. to do the coding, and they are covered in this course as well.  Not very deep, but sufficient. Wish they may pick PyTorch in the future as well.
The notebook and grading systems sometime have issues though. You may think you submitted the right data but actually the server side won't think so.  Hard lessons learnt are:  a) save the original ipynb before coding, so you can always rollback in case notebook messed up; b) save a checkpoint before submit, this will force saving and ensure you submitted the latest data, otherwise, it may submit incomplete data - some cells may still have very old data even you modified a lot;  c) open anther local Jupyter notebook to experiment and mess around,  with interactive TensorFlow exception, but pay attention to the expression with random sequences, when you call eval() the second time, they may have totally different value even you reset the seed upon each cell, eval() will invoke your expression again which will consume more data in the random sequence;   d)  never use iPad to complete your noetbook coding, :-).

Professor Andrew Ng, makes very comprehensible the content of the course.
 
Here why:
-He decompose every element of CNN. Convolutions, 1x1 convolutions and  pooling are very well explained, then by yourself can derive the dimensions of the output after applying these operations.
-He make notes on the fly for derive equations and  explain the purpose of the equations.  For me is much better that  only show slides, because makes give me the oportunity to think of the equation before is show.
-Professor give you  Intiition in every topic.
- He Make several examples of modern architectures of CNNs.Always write down in detail the architectures. 
-Clear notation, uses the same notation in programming exercises 
-Programming exercises are the best documente ones. This makes relatively easy to implement the exercises. If struggle with operations, they provide links to the documentation necessary.
Was an amazing course.

CNNs are amongst the most advanced areas of DL and understanding the concepts can help develop intuition about how to solve DL problems in other domains. I greatly enjoyed this course. As with all of Andrew Ng's courses, the explanations are clear and help develop intuition. This course seems to have more references to academic papers than the others and Andrew is encouraging and helpful in guiding the student to the accessible and relevant sections of the papers.The exercises are instructive and not too challenging. Most of the challenges I had were due to my own programming errors and occasionally an error in how the exercise is set up [make sure to use the most recent version of Jupiter notebooks]. One exercise in Week 4 (Neural Style Transfer) does assume more Tensorflow knowledge than the other exercises.

I would also recommend to take cs20 class by stanford which teaches tensorflow very well or you can refer the youtube videos for tensorflow also. The key thing is whatever you study you have to keep coming back to look at the assignments what you've done , play with it, understand it, and see how you can relate this on theory.
The video lectures is pretty striaght forward, not much mathematical jargon, but its intermediate level of sort, but i recommend to watch atmost 5 times every video if you didn't get through once, don't rush, take pen and paper and also write.

- Courses don't teach enough Keras & Tensorflow syntax to be completely stand-alone.  If you take this course, you won't really be able to build your own DNN's unless you also take a separate Keras / Tensorflow course.
- Links to Keras documentation are broken -- they now take you to the general Keras homepage, not the specific command's page.
- In later courses, Andrew Ng's lectures are not edited.  Starting around the 4th course, you start hearing Dr. Ng stop and repeat portions of the lecture, presumably intending the first attempt to be edited out in the future.  Usually this is easy to ignore, but in some cases he repeats 30-60 seconds of lecture, which can be confusing.
- In the last course (sequence models), the text captions of Dr. Ng's lecture have a lot of mistakes, which is a little ironic for a course on speech-to-text ",5

Prof. Andrew doesn’t just tell you the name of a function for a library (like scikit

The specialization is well divided into meaningful courses and each course is well structured so that you know exactly what you are going to learn and what key specific skills you will get after completion of a course.

This is definitely for those with no previous experience with CNN or just small/moderate amount of it.

Takes me back to a number of problems I worked on in my days in ""image understanding"" / computer vision. Really interesting to see how a deep learning approach contrasts with some of the early attempts at explicit image feature extraction and symbolic reasoning that we were doing back then. And yet, many of the same core concepts are woven throughout the deep learning approach -- image convolution, edge detection and segmentation, ""area of interest"" (AOI) operators multi-resolution feature spaces, ... - all of these are still embedded - now implicitly - in the layers of the networks.

One feedback I would have is: many of the lecture assignments contain ""mundane"" in-between tasks, like normalization by 255.0, accessing outputs of certain layers, plotting code, etc. The code snippets for these are already provided and we don't have to implement anything. But I think it is valuable to learn how to write this ""glue code"".

The only real negative is the flaky behavior of Jupyter notebooks.  More than once I have gotten results that turn out to be incorrect, even though my code is correct.  The fix is to restart the kernel, sometimes it takes several tries.  This is confusing and frustrating.  I wasn't a big fan of Jupyter notebooks before this course and its behavior has done little to change my mind.

Things get harder in this stage as we go through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), that are more difficult to understand than ""simple"" neural networks  (Course 1 now looks easy to me...). Well-designed programming assignments along with nice course materials. You will understand how work image recognition in general, which is used for many problems like: image classifiers, face verification/recognition, object detection in real-time (YOLO algorithm)  and even artistic creation (Neural Type Transfer). An important course that is worth the time and effort. Iv' learned many things.",5
1456,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Glenn B,"Jun 1, 2018","Great topics and discussion, however the lectures started to gloss over the details of implementation which were left entirely to the exercises.
Use of Tensorflow and Keras required more background to clearly do the exercises than provided in the tutorials or examples.
 I get the dynamic aspect of writing the lecture notes in the videos, however the lecture notes should be ""cleaned up"" in the downloadable files (i.e., typos corrected and typed up).  Additionally, the notes written in the video could be written and organized more clearly (e.g., uniform directional flow across the page/screen rather than randomly fit wherever on the page.  ",5
1457,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Charles M,"Aug 20, 2018","Excellent material taught by the best, Andrew Ng. Very relevant to my interest and career goals. The object detector section was especially helpful for my work at a small startup. The material is top notch and more detailed of what I got during my masters in computer science. The code examples and assignments are very fun and rewarding. There are some slight glitches during saving and submitting assignments, so i always made a backup copy. Other than that, the course was great. I skipped directly to convolutional neural networks since I am already familiar with deep learning. However, i eventually wanted to finish all 4 courses. ",5
1458,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Infa t,"May 1, 2018","Great diving into the cutting edge computer vision algorithms (such as YOLO), the state of the art CNN architectures(ResNet, VGG, Inception Network, Siamese Network), with a variety of applications of this architectures and algorithms, such as self-driving system, neural style transfer generator and face recognition and verification! Very simple and understandable submission of very hard to read and realize machine learning papers, perfect explanationof the cutting edge machine learning algorithms, architectures and approaches used in this field. I'm so pleased with the quality in this course! It helped me VERY MUCH! Thank you",5
1459,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Artem M,"May 19, 2018","This course is not very deep mathematically (which is not very good. Again, additional material on the derivation of gradient descent for filters could be provided) but it is deep learning, so it is expected. On the other hand, the contents are just wonderful. It was my first exposure to computer vision/CNNs, and I can say that the introduction here is absolutely the best. It covers a lot of topics (new and not so new). Finishing this course will make you well aware of how convolutional NNs work and point you towards particular areas depending on your interests. By far the best introductory course in this specialisation. ",5
1460,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Noor A,"Mar 28, 2020",Great introduction to the topic. For people who would like a case study oriented course this is it. The amount of content is also very impressive even if slightly dated. I have spent almost 2 years actively doing research and working with CNN's but the course still had a lot to offer in terms of content. It would've been the perfect starter pack if there was a section on image segmentation. Maybe there could be a complete course on Ng just covering case studies and research papers. Regardless attending this course is a must. The assignments are well curated and I can image will be extremely forgiving towards beginners.,5
1461,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Guy M,"Sep 6, 2018","This is a great introduction to what CNNs are and how to implement them in a framework. My one almost-gripe is that when it comes to the assignment it can leave you floundering because there is minimal coverage of some of the requisite knowledge of running a NN using the framework. I'm all for making students work things out, but in one or two ways it was just a bit too high of a step to expect a student to climb. I'm talking here about the steps required to actually run a NN and then make a prediction. By contrast, several of the much easier steps might have a hint such as ""You might find the ... function useful"".",5
1462,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Zhiming C,"May 30, 2020","This is a very good course. It contains quite a lot important CNN topics and models, which are state of art and very popular nowadays in industry. Although the contents are only aiming at some introductions of these topics, we can still get a very good impression of what it is and how it works. The exercises are relative simple, because to implement a real network and to train it will take quite a lot time. I think if there would be a implementation of e.g. model in detail, we can be more familiar with the contents. All in one, it is a very good course and covers a lot of useful models and information!",5
1463,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,David R R,"Nov 28, 2017","This is a very interesting and functional course. Week 1 gives you the basic ideas behind CNN and it is very easy to follow the videos. The next weeks gives you what are under the hood in object detection systems, other CNN architectures, style use... I recommend this course
Este es un curso interesante y sobre todo funcional. La primera semana te enseña las ideas básicas detras de un CNN ademas de que son lecturas faciles de seguir. Las siguientes semanas te enseñan los ""secretos"" de los sitemas de detección de objetos, otras arquitecturas de CNN, uso artistico de las mismas... Recomiendo el curso",5

It provides a deep understanding of convolutional neural networks and the various architectures used by state-of-the-art models. We get to learn various concepts of computer vision - image classification, localization, image detection, face verification, face recognition and neural style transfer. Ii  would have been better if course also covered image segmentation. We get much needed hands-on through interesting assignments and along the way we get to learn Tensorflow and Keras.

And i was not disappointed. I already knew the scope of CNNs, but to see them in work from up close was a treat. This course teaches you the fine intricacies of Convolutional Neural Network. It also showcases the working of some really famous models that were built in the last few years. I hope this course can be extended to include the applications of CNN in NLP as well. This course is a must for budding Deep Learning Researchers. I cannot wait to apply the learnings in real life.",5

In this tutorial I have not only understood how to implement things but I have also learnt what's the math behind those things. It is important at-least for me because it allows me to do more experiments with CNN's or in general Neural Networks. The thing which I like most about this course is its programming exercises. 
I recommend this whole series to those people who want to learn some advance machine learning stuff like GAN, variational autoencoders and Reinforcement learning. This series will help as a strong foundation.",5
1467,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Yilun Y,"Apr 6, 2019","Overall an awesome course, however, it somewhat lacks some important topics and models such as SSD, Faster RCNN, mask RCNN, etc which are even more frequently mentioned in literature and applied in real world projects. This course really sparked my curiosity and passion in deep learning, I actually learned the models mentioned before by reading the original paper and many useful blogs. This is a long but rewarding journey, I would also like to see more topics be covered in this course and let more people know how these state-of-art models work and how they really change the world.

1468,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Xiang J,"Nov 4, 2019","I really like this course, because it not only taught me the exciting new topics that I always want to learn, such as object detection algorithm and neural style transfer, but also it gave a solid introduction to the concepts of convolution. The assignments are great, it is fun to do and it also helped me more concretely understand the materials of main course. As to further improve the course, may be it would be nice to build a whole end-to-end pipeline including training the main convolution model in car detection as I know in Google colab even public users have access to GPUs.",5

I wish there was a little bit more engagement from mentor side as well as updates on the coursework with the latest developments in the object detection field. I also wish that there were a little bit more involved programming exercises, maybe one in ""training"" where one has to label objects and ""train"" a neural net. One of the things that I missed in the course is an explanation of the Neural Network architectures and why they work - e.g. the VCCG-16 or Inception Network - for example. Maybe one has to read the papers to understand them?",5
1470,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Shankar G,"Jul 8, 2018","This part of the CNNs course in DL was awesome and long enough. It started with foundations of CNNs, where the concepts of CNNs layers was made very clear. Programming assignments helped understanding the layering activation properly. The good part was DeepCNNs case studies explanation with its pros and cons, plus the practical advice for using ConvNets. Also this course provided few papers applications like object detection, face recognition and neural style transfer which was amazing. All the quizzes and programming assignments refreshed the concepts in a good manner.",5

However, the exercises are fascinating, fun and outright brilliant nonetheless! It's worth completing this to gain an insightful and eventually coded math understanding of concepts such as neural style transfer and facial recognition.  This can never get boring!",5
1478,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Martin K,"Jan 15, 2019","Andrews unique way  of presenting complex theoretical concepts in a compelling and easy to 
understand manner was essential for my learning success. Attending this course was fun. Even though the programming assignments were pretty tough in this course (for me the toughest of all the courses in the deep learning specialization), I managed to complete this course in (my) record time. This might be mostly due to the understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts which were outstandingly well presented.
Totally recommend this course!",5
1479,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,David A G,"Mar 16, 2018","The course was excellent. I really enjoy Andrew Ng's courses: complex stuff made easy and lots of practical applications.
The only thing that I would try to improve is the time the staff dedicates to check the forum to solve student's questions. I personally got stuck at one of the quizzes and it was hard to find any clue that might help to understand the right answer. Also, some really interesting general questions on the forum were not replied by anyone. I'm sure some expert help on the forum would bring great value to the course.",5

1481,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Joris,"Feb 25, 2018","The best course (yet). A good balance between theory and practice, although the complete lack of TensorFlow and Keras fundamentals can be a bit frustrating. Additionally, the use of numpy operations (add, multiply and such) gave the impression that you'd correctly done a function assignment (the check values were OK), however, the grader failed to accept it as being correct (which was justified), however, an indication that it was incorrect (or some comments in the accompanying text) would've saved me 30 minutes of searching.",5

1484,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Virginia,"Feb 24, 2019","The course is a perfect balance between theoretical explanations,  application in programming and tips that can be helpful if you intend to work with CNN. I had not seen CNN before, and I didn't feel lost at any moment. Every doubt I had was perfectly answered in the forum.  You don't need much of an experience with TensorFlow or Keras to do the labs, which are accompanied by thorough explanations of what is required; on the other hand, there are ""extra"" tasks for people who want to go more into depth in each lab.",5
1485,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Vincent F,"Feb 8, 2018","Overall a very good course for the instruction. Found only two omissions with the programming assignment notebooks. One was where a function expected a tensor but the parameter we were encouraged to provide was an array. Had to use a convert to tensor call. The other was a mismatch between the expected output block and the grader. This has been noted already but has not yet been fixed. But quite minor all in all. 
Really liked the links to the academic papers that are the source of the models used. Thanks again.",5
1486,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Maximiliano B,"Jan 2, 2020","In this module of the specialization, you will be familiar with several types of convolutional neural networks and how do they work in details.

I understand the limitations of covering only so much material in 4 weeks.  Wish the course could have gone deeper on training YOLO.  I had to do this myself from the darknet website with some other tutorials.  Something to consider, implementations of Unet and Mask RCNN may be even more useful for precise object masking/detection rather than bounding box in the future.  May be worth mentioning these techniques as they develop further.",5
1490,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Shehryar M K K,"Apr 30, 2018",This is the 4th course in the series of deep learning that I finished. It was very enjoyable. The topic is deep and the instructor referred to papers and their implementation as exercises. Inception networks and ResNet exercises were my favorite and I learned a lot from them. The other assignments were good but weren't enjoyable as the two mentioned above. I would suggest the instructor incorporates some reading materials in the course which can be tested in the quizzes.

The structure of the information content makes the learning experience all the more valuable, and makes the learner yearn for more.

I have some background in image and signal processing and the mathematical properties of convolutions; so I it made sense to me that they would be useful in deep learning for image processing.  However, that point was amplified for me when Andrew Ng showed how a convolutional layer compared to a fully connected layer: The idea that a convolutional layer was achieved through parameter sharing and masking (forcing parameters to 0) and was in a sense a form of regularization was eye-opening.",5

Overall very interesting, however I think i lack some basic understanding of tensorflow concept. I would like to have more examples and explanations of it. Its just that its often unclear: this only defines the tensor, and here we evaluate it, and if I run it again, does it compute from the begging or it remembers the value, and so on. This maybe refers more to the previous course. And besides that, would be great to have some text summaries of the material. :) Thank you",5
1496,Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.AI,Luis E R,"Apr 4, 2019","Andrew's teaching is exceptional, he finds the right way to convey the necessary information for complex concepts, he does not skip them but strikes the right balance of not going too deep, however he does warn you in a way, that you need to study them on your own.
I think the course, will give you very strong foundations if you take time to understand what you are really doing and what the algorithms are doing.
After this I think you will require a lot of practice with several examples on you own,",5

1526,Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel by Microsoft,Berke F,"Sep 25, 2023","I think the course structure is good and the lessons are very clear, but there were a couple of things that caused inconvenience. Firstly, the difference of software (Microsoft 365 Excel) between the live version and the version in the video caused a lot of issues. I had to guess some questions because it is an outdated version. And secondly, some questions were too specific. There was a question about the maximum number of rows in Excel. True or False for ""There are one million."" It is unclear from the question whether it is an approximation or whether they are asking for the actual value, 1,048,576. Replacing the number in the question with an unambiguous number such as ""two million"" or ""one billion"" could be better. This is the only mistake I had in the final exam and now my grade is not 100% :(",4
1527,Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel by Microsoft,MD. O A,"Feb 7, 2024","I recently completed the 'Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel' course, and I must say it was an incredibly enriching experience. As someone relatively new to data analysis, I found the course to be exceptionally well-structured and comprehensive.

The instructors did an excellent job of breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible chunks, making them accessible even for beginners like myself. From understanding the basics of Excel to mastering advanced functions and formulas, every module was thoughtfully designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a solid understanding of the material.

One aspect that stood out to me was the practical approach taken throughout the course. Instead of just learning theoretical concepts, we were given real-world examples and hands-on exercises to apply what we learned. This not only reinforced our understanding but also gave us the confidence to tackle data analysis tasks in our own work.

Furthermore, the course provided valuable insights into best practices for data cleaning, standardisation, and visualisation, which are essential skills for anyone working with data. I particularly appreciated the tips and tricks shared by the instructors, which I can now apply to streamline my own workflow.

Overall, I can confidently say that the 'Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel' course has significantly enhanced my data analysis skills and equipped me with the tools and knowledge needed to excel in my professional endeavours.

1647,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,David S,"Sep 14, 2020","In my opinion this course is an important part of the specialization. But a number of issues made it fall short of a five star rating.
First the positives: 
Of the three courses I've taken so far, the quizzes showed great creativity, which made learning fun. Well done.
  Unapologetically this course does not require students to write a single line of code. Instead it necessarily addresses issues that coders and their managers need to consider. It's not 'fluff,' but real decision points for machine learning applications. So I found this course of value for the specialization. 
Here's what keeps it from five stars.
I think that there ought to be mini-quizzes at the end of every lecture so as to reinforce learning, rather than once at the end of 10 to 12 videos.
This course is probably the right place in the specialization to include a section on the shortfalls of machine learning. So far the specialization takes the perspective of happy technicians solving the world's problems through machine learning. I think it appropriate to spend some time on how machine learning caused such a grading problem during COVID-19 (in the UK and for the International Baccalaureate), how thousands in state employment can skew results by data input and the like. 
Finally, as a small but jarring note - can't somebody re-edit some of the videos? Having audio repeated, hearing ""test test,"" and microphone problems are shortcomings not expected from a course that endeavours to teach professionals. 
Overall four stars.

This course is the third in the deeplearning.ai series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng.  This is a relatively short course as compared to the other courses in this series.  However, there are quite a few videos to watch and learn from.  This course is really a series of practical advice, strategies and analysis techniques that are an indispensable part of the ML/DL toolbox of a practitioner.  The techniques are presented through a series of examples and Dr. Ng helps beat the ""practical theory"" into the student very well.  
I was at first disappointed that there were no programming proects.

Andrew definitely has a thing to explain complicated stuff in the easy way, e.g. the part where he explained how Adam works in Course 2 is truly amazing.
But this course is really different. It appears to have no technical details and I can see some people may consider this course worthless or make disparaging remarks. But based on my personal experience, what he taught in this class is really important and kind of shapes the way one needs to think about how to tackle a machine learning project from the start. As researchers and engineers, it's easy for us to delve into the technical details and algorithm approaches, papers too early when the overall direction is not too clear yet. I feel very grateful for what Andrew did by sharing his knowledge to all of us.

Overall the courses in the specialization are great and provide great introduction to these topics, as well as practical experience. Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.
There are a few shortbacks:
1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.
2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).
3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.
4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. Not sure I would have taken it as a stand-alone course, though.
5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 
6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck. 
Again overall - highly recommended",3
1651,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Marina R,"Oct 19, 2017","I found the course rather confusing than helpful. One of the key issues with video-only courses is lack of interaction of the user with the material. In previous Andrew's ML courses, this issue was cunningly tackled with ""wake-up"" multiple choice mini-quizzes. Such techniques would help the course a lot.
The questions in the exam were poorly phrased and full of typos; some had numerical issues (percentage of errors in the dev set did not sum up).  Some of the answers seemed to contradict with the material as I remembered it from the course: f.e., the question on whether to get more foggy images to improve the model performance should have been answered with ""augmentation is fine as long as it looks fine to the human eye"". This contradicts to Andrew's remarks in the course video ""Addressing data mismatch"" video -> Artificial data synthesis. Are you sure we would not introduce a bias by adding artificial fog to frontal camera images? ",2

The course itself avoids many professional terms, so that most people can understand.
Introduced very valuable experience on how to think about the direction of effort and how to avoid wasting a lot of time.
Cons:
The problem with avoiding mentioning the program code itself is that although a lot of concepts are mentioned, there is still no sense of actual operation. A little simple example would help. It could be in the optional reading materials.
Use too many ""so"" for transition. Very confusing. Please use accurate transitions, or just pause it a while.
Often jump from what was talking about to something else suddenly. This is very confusing and hard to keep focusing and understanding. Maybe this is also because of the ""so"" problem.",2

One or two videos could also do with better editing work: I could hear Andrew making a soundcheck, and there's a 30sec segment that's played twice in a row.

The second issue I find with the course is that there are no programming assignments. Programming assignments. Programming assignments are key to understanding such complex topics and getting the idea cemented. It would have been much better, if we could cover each topic such as data-mismatch, comparison to human level performance, etc via assignments. ",2

Transfer learning or multitasking based on material from the previous courses would have been great. Knowing that these techniques exist is not enough.
A project teaching how to remove the last layer and retrain to learn a different task would have been very exciting and informative.

1665,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Victoria D,"Nov 29, 2019","this was definitely a useful course, as it addressed the 'art' of machine learning.
For me, the mathematics and writing code is easy - that's the science; however, it is equally important to have heuristics for deciding what sort of learning algorithm(s) to try, and how to start, and how to iterate.
That being said, some of the terminology is peculiar - satisficing, for example, is that even a real word?.
In the software requirements engineering field, we'd call that performance requirements ( for run-time speed), or perhaps non-functional requirements( memory usage), depending on the metric.
Also, in the second week, there was a discussion of error priorities for the autonomous vehicle example and quiz where a safety-critical requirement was not taken into consideration at all.
Spoiler Alert: If I am building the AI and control systems for a vehicle ( autonomous or otherwise), , that has to work in all weather conditions, no matter how hard it might be to get the necessary training data.  Qualifying the answer with 'all other things being equal' never applies to safety-critical systems.",5

In other words, there are many advice and suggestions this course offers that I hadn't thought of, but ""obvious"" once I learned them. Well, I need to hear them, and I'm glad I took this course. BTW , the assignments are essential. You can apply not only what's discussed in the lectures, but also learn new ""common sense"" methodology.",5
1686,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Muluh P T,"Feb 15, 2018","The course content is very theoretical but packed with very very applicable information for improving machine learning systems. The use of simulation exercises at the end of each week really goes a long way to compensate for the theoretical nature of the course content by giving learners the ability to think in terms of a real world project and seek ways to make it better. Technically speaking, I found this course more important than most practical courses that are filled with coding exercises without any additional information around making the code perform better. Great content!!!",5
1687,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Ricardo S,"Dec 17, 2017","This is a short high value course. It is especially good for someone who is trying to get into machine learning at a professional level, to avoid the usual pits of project structuring and time management. Highly recommended. It might seem less motivating, because it is perhaps less technical than other courses in the deep learning series, and does not have programming assignments, but in my view it might actually be at least as important as the more technical courses (if not more) in terms of allowing students to deliver machine learning projects in a professional context.",5
1688,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Srikrishna R,"Aug 13, 2018","This course provides insights that you normally wouldn't get reading a book alone. While it does cover the core theories behind structuring of projects, what sets it apart is the truly practical tips and tricks that you could put to use in your project right away. The guidance is actionable and draws from practical experience of stalwarts rather than draw from theory alone. The test & exercise was quite innovative too as it puts you through a real world simulation to help you understand decision pathways you would take based on situational role play. Overall 5 stars!",5

I really appreciate the hands-on quizzes as well, as they gave me a chance to critically think through what I had just learned, and apply it to a real-world example. They especially helped when I got things wrong, because then I was able to rethink some assumptions I had made, and solidified my understanding of the material. I hope the next two courses are just as good as the last three!",5

Sure, the others might offer more technical expertise, but this trains you things that cannot be taught in a class or a lecture. The application oriented case studies are extremely intriguing and challenging to a person whose knowledge might be completely theoretical. This course trains you to think in real life situations of applying a deep learning model, where to cut costs and effort, where to add more, how to optimize your model to surpass even the human level, and go further etc..",5

I checked in a couple of machine leaning books and couldn't find equivalent advice. I particularly liked the point that was made about machine learning and certain ideas becoming obsolete (having previously done a PhD in machine learning) as I had that impression myself and was discussing it with a colleague this very week!",5
1696,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Emily,"Oct 7, 2018",I like how it discusses everything on a strategic level. Very helpful when leading AI teams in the office. I wish there were a couple more case studies on different AI topics like natural language or signal processing or dialog systems. These are hot topics in the industry and academia and would be helpful to both professionals and students working on these problems to gain some insights to these problems as well.

To me, this kind of classes are higher quality training data for for the NN inside my skull than theory classes of something encapsulated in a library ;). It would take me decades of practice to reach these conclusions. Thank you for the wisdom!",5

1699,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Anders S,"Dec 24, 2017","Best applied course I have taken so far. Very practical, great to do before starting a project. I do have a suggestion for the specialisation in general. I have been working with deep learning, specifically image recognition and I have had a hard time figuring out what images I need to feed into my algorithms. Material about what type of data is needed to train algorithms correctly and overall requirements of this data would be great. I know this is done in some level, but not in a level of detail necessary for a project.",5
1700,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Jon J,"Dec 5, 2020","Out of the deep learning specialisation courses so far for me, this has been one of the most valuable. Although iterating through solutions for deep learning problems is becoming faster, it's clear that huge amounts of time can be lost spending time chasing ghosts, as there are many areas in which empirical observation is the key to success. Some of the answers to questions posed in the quiz might seem counter-intuitive, but I believe the course sets up a solid framework with which to quantify solutions and approaches.",5
1701,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,J A,"Sep 8, 2017","Probably the best course to learn how to approach a Machine Learning project and deal with all the multiple challenges and issues which arise in real applications. Lots of years and experience of ML work distilled in a set of practical recommendations which can save one and entire teams months of work and computing expenses. The quizzes, based on simulated real cases, help mastering the recommendations. An ideal course for the more novice practitioners to catch up  with the most expert ones in just a couple of weeks!",5

This is the first course I've seen that gives a ""big picture"" overview on *how to approach* new machine learning / deep learning projects. It dives into how to structure the project, how to separate training / validation / test datasets, how to perform error analysis when your errors are high, how to trade-off bias/variance, and when and how to apply end-to-end deep learning. In short, this course is about finding the right trails, rather than going deep in the forest. Highly recommended! 👍",5

Andrew generalized the topics so effectively that I could relate similar experience to understand the concepts.  I love Andrew's simplistic, repetitive, regressive approach so if things aren't clear in the first go, you can trust him to reviw them at the right opportunity.

1708,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Artem D,"May 29, 2019","This is a very interesting course with very useful recommendations which could be also applied to ML projects. I highly recommend this material.
The only downside is that the course is structured as 1-1.5 hours of lectures and then practice quizzes (which are actually very interesting). And as for me, it becomes boring just listening without hands-on then, say, 15 minutes, despite the material itself is very interesting.
I hope that the next courses will have more practice.
All-in-all, a very good course!",5

Most of the stuff in this course is what is important for practitioners and is missing in other courses, I think most of the organizations and teams miss out on the strategy and devote far more time in wandering in wrong directions.  It would be helpful if at certain points when referring to some concepts, a brief recap be given. There are too many concepts in other courses that at times you have strain yourself to recall. It is good mental exercise but it may help some folks.",5

1711,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Benny P,"Feb 24, 2018","This is a very good course on machine learning subjects that are rarely discussed elsewhere, namely managing machine learning project. And surprisingly, despite the easy feel of the subjects and their explanation in the video, the decision making that you have to take (and is tested in the quiz) in simulated project is hard. As project leader, given many choices of things to do, it's hard to decide what's the best thing to do, and this course shows, teaches, and trains you how to do that.",5

Firstly, this course doesn't teach you the hard and fast rules, that we are accustomed to in traditional computing. This course helps you develop intuitions about measuring the performance and efficiency of our Machine Learning System. This is going to be of extreme importance to all of us. The other courses can tell you how to design a system. This course will tell you how good/bad your system is, and how you can improve it further. ",5

interviews with influential people on the field of DL are included and 
make the student fall in love with DL even more. Excited to see what's 
next in this specialization.",5
1714,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Bruce W,"Aug 20, 2020","This was a good course, overall.  It covered a lot of the decisions you need to make, when configuring and working to improve your neural network models.
There are not actual flight simulators.  That is just how some of the learning exercises are described.
This course made me think about a lot of things--for example, is it better to simulate noise in ""clean"" data or to try to filter noise out of noisy data.  Obviously, this course is just a stepping-off point for your own explorations.",5
1715,Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.AI,Guy M,"Sep 6, 2018","This course felt a bit out of sequence in that it left behind the more ""hands on"" notebook coding for a higher level ""How to manage an AI team/project"". This made sense when I realised it used to be the last of a three-course specialization. Aside from how it fits into the flow of the specialization (which then moves on to get technical again with CNNs and RNNs), it's jam packed full of incredibly sound advice that even experienced team leads would probably benefit from reviewing.",5

Error information are frequently uninformative. It is not possible to check part of the code (see W4) 
 The use of ""Slack"" is not proper; information it is not easily accessible, unorganized and it demands on students the learning of new tools and additional payments.

1818,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Achkan S,"Aug 29, 2020","This course has too many problems as it stands:
1) They haven't chosen an audience: the concept that they explain are trivial for anyone having (even basic) machine learning (or even basic linear algebra) knowledge. However, it doesn't meant that this explanations would be useful for beginners: they are too short and incomplete (the ""videos"" are on average 3 minutes long!!) and what they focus on is often not the most relevant part.
2) There is no reading material: no books, no papers, no theory. It wouldn't be a problem if the videos themselves were decent, but most of them are about 1 minute long. You can't explain machine learning in such a short time. 
3) The code of the assignments, especially assignment 4, is unclean (e.g. unused variables) and contains minor bugs. 
4) The script that grades the assignments has very strict requirements: as an example, very often, if you use x.dot(A) instead of np(x,A), then it complains and says you've failed. This happens for a lot of numpy functions, and it makes the process of submitting results tedious.
5) Again, regarding the course material itself, many of the key aspects are not discussed. For example, word embeddings are given that have some nice properties, but its never explained how they have been obtained.

I have  ambiguous impressions about this course. Seems, the best DeepLearning.ai courses are those taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. 
To sum up, I think, lectures duration should be increased and more deep intuition should be provided. Programming assignments are peace of cake for experienced programmer, but are OK for beginners. Also, there are many incomprehensible mistakes in programming tasks, which I suppose will be fixed later. Nevertheless, I recommend this course for those who want to start a journey to NLP world.

Cons: Sometimes it feels like one has to guess sometimes what they grader wants in the exercise at other times it feels like spoon-feeding. There can be better balance and error output explanations. More test cases for the assignments are needed to verify intermediate function outputs. Also, sometimes the course instructor mentions that you do not have to understand this concept or you can easily look it up online. This is not very encouraging because of course, one can look things up on the internet. It would be better suited to explain things however briefly it may be.

The coding was just using statistical methods to draw linguistic inferences from these vectors.  I find it unfortunate that we didn't have an opportunity to learn how the vectors themselves are made (or did I miss something?), but merely got them out of a can from Google.It took me a while to figure out that the homeworks are graded by an AI, not a TA, and that one can submit the homework assignments numerous times until getting the grade you want.  Given the large number of students enrolled, I can understand that hand grading would not be an option.  It would probably be helpful to explain this to newcomers like me.I liked the way the assignments are structured. the fill-in-the-blanks approach, followed by some sort of numerical unit test to let us know if our solution was correct is good pedagogy (androgogy?).  My only criticism is that sometimes the unit tests are not very sensitive to common coding errors.  But now I know that we always have the option of running our assignment through the autograder for more complete feedback.The autograder is often overly prescriptive.  For example, ""Function 'np.sign or np.heaviside' not found in Code Cell UNQ_C17.""  Python is a rich language and there are many ways to code C17 without using those particular functions.  The goal should be to get students to solve a problem creatively -- not to follow a particular path.I found the week 4 assignment a real bear -- too long (22 completion sections) in comparison with the others.  I'm sure it was difficult for whoever codes the autograder as well.  They need to do some more code checking.  In UNQ__C8 we were asked to use the pre-coded cosine_similarity function.  Initially this was returning the cosine difference, which is quite the opposite.  In the middle of last week, after I and others reported the error, it was corrected but this seems to have created a cascade of other errors.  For example, in cell UNQ_C9, We are toldExpected Output:[[9 9 9] [1 0 5] [2 0 1]] Which is wrong.  A look at the vectors is enough to see that  (2,0,1) is closest to (1,0,1) by cosine similarity.  I believe the autograder makes the same confusion.  I mention this not to criticize our hard-working programmer, who is otherwise doing an excellent job, but so that the errors get fixed ;-) (edited) ",4

1839,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Artem R,"Jul 2, 2020","I've got strange feelings about this course. If we are talking about courses from deeplearning.ai, it all started with Tensorflow in Practice specialization. 
This course have should have 2 weeks or maybe one, because everything can be accomplished in a few days. 
It has very small amount of interesting content. 
It is repetitive (some parts of assignments are copied from Deep Learning specialization assignments).
The video lessons are strange - it seems that two instructors recorded same videos and only beginning and ending from Łukasz Kaiser's videos got to the course (which is not fair).
Some procedures don't have description for function's arguments. Some procedures don't have testing function - you don't know if it works or not.
This course should be a part of another course, because it doesn't seem as a complete course. It feels like it doesn't completed, like it is a draft for a full course. 
I believe that others courses from this specialization will be better. If you know Russian, I suggest you to take course about NLP on Stepik platform https://stepik.org/course/54098/syllabus. It is much better.",3

The instructor was too young. The lectures were not explaining anything that was included in the labs. The course learning objectives were entirely different from the course itself. The course requires expertise in python that is not written anywhere. The lectures and Labs are in different dimensions.  Everything that you want to learn will be in assignments that will not be taught in course lectures. It means that all the burden will be on your shoulders. Lecture videos are just about the intro and expect everything as an expert to be done in the assignments. It seems that it's a blog instead of a taught course.

Enhancement opportunities:
I felt the PCA lectures and PCA function implementation were a bit muddled.  Consider illustrating the geometric intuition behind PCA:  when 2-D data points are projected onto a line, the ""best"" line maximizes variance along the line while minimizing the reconstruction error of the data points.
The final notebook assignment is long and contains a large number of function and global variables.  It is a lot to digest.  Maybe enhance it with a takeaway video that unlocks after the assignment is passed.  The video will visually recap what was accomplished by showing the start-to-end pipeline.

The video lectures can be improved upon -- many of these are essentially the lecturer reading over a high-level description of a given concept, as opposed to detailed explanations (e.g., SVD & PCA topic).  The unit tests for the assignments also need to be more robust and/or error messages generated by the auto-grader need to be more specific.  You should not routinely see cases where ""All Tests Pass"" for ALL cells in the assignment notebook and yet the auto-grader fails to assign credit for 1+ modules, forcing the student to trouble-shoot issues that were not caught by the unit tests and for which the auto-grader error logs are unavailable.",4

1871,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Ben S,"Apr 19, 2021","By far the worst course I have ever done. 
The 'lectures' are just a few minutes long and as expected are very thin. Moreover, the majority (yes > 50%) of the lectures are spent explaining basic linear algebra (much of which is high school level) and hardly any time is spent on NLP itself. Most of the core NLP concepts are barely mentioned and it is obvious that the labs were written by someone else than the person who wrote the lectures as terminology gaps / differences exist and as the content is very thin it's impossible to put two and two together.
The readings are simply annotation summaries of the already brief lectures. They add no value.
The labs do not support learning in anyway. They are simply a 'fill in the gaps' exercise where > 50% of this would simply be figuring out which variable you need to index inside a loop. It is a joke.
The only good aspect of this course is the slack community and is the only thing I can recommend.

Not only does this course go too fast and doesn't explain the intuition and reason behind concepts, the labs are outdated and have terrible unit tests. I work by day and study by night, only to find a programming assignment (week 2) that has terrible unit tests. It tells you that 12 tests passed and 3 didn't. Why? Who the hell knows why?

Another suggestion is to postpone the implementation of SGD until after you get some warm-up in numpy during week 2-3. All in all I quite enjoyed the approach to be able to build the tools myself with numpy. This way, it demystifies the use of pre-built packages and lets the learner indeed understand what is going on under the hood.

1902,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Michael G A,"Sep 7, 2023",Wonder  and deeply informative course. Does not brush over details and gives you mathematical insights without being too overbearing. This course treats you as an educated person with sufficient and concise explanation to allow you to not just apply python functions without any knowledge. I am truly satisfied by the way this course is handled,5
1903,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Yongjae P,"Jan 8, 2021","This is the best course for NLP beginner. Most of lectures deal with pytorch or tensorflow directly, but I think that kind of approach might hurt fundamental thinking which is really important when starting. In this course, you should search for usage of numpy and linear algebra to understand NLP. I truly recommend this course!",5
1904,Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces by DeepLearning.AI,Camila A B,"Jan 3, 2021","I really liked the course as an opportunity to glance at NLP.

1938,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Radhika K,"Feb 8, 2019","The course concentrates more on Maths rather than explaining how algorithm can be implemented in Python. This is difficult for a someone with less knowledge in Maths. 
The lab exercises when compared to rest of the course is not satisfactory because in lab sessions, the algorithms were not explained and lacks Student excercise. It also lacks clarity around when to use which algorithm.",1
1939,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Vincent L,"Sep 14, 2018","Errors in the presentations and in the Jupyter workbooks, plenty of typos. Not professional at all.
The course does cover the topics and give us some practice exercises, but when I don't get the right result I cannot know if I don't understand a topic properly or if the instructor made a mistake without checking on other web resources. Plus, some approaches are just dubious, like normalizing by dividing by the max value. There are many other ways to do so that make no assumption on the data distribution.",2
1940,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Dylan H,"Jun 10, 2019","Good theoretical background on how some machine learning tasks actually work mathematically, but, to be quite frank, much of it is a) not necessary, (i.e. I've used regression as a prime aspect of my job for approaching 3 decades now, and have never known that it used partial derivatives to determine what elements to vary, but, quite frankly, that knowledge has never been required or even vaguely useful for either its use or explanation) b) presented in a way that, as soon as it begins to get interesting from an algorithmic standpoint, stops with a ""beyond the scope of this class,"" (to be fair, I have a -major- pet peeve about that phrase from working with developers for decades) and c) if such depth of knowledge was considered important, it should have been split up amongst more classes - i.e. at the point someone takes this class, they've been through 7 other classes in the IBM Data Science track, and only 3 of them have presented enough and important enough info that I've even bothered to keep notes for future reference.  Instead of 4 classes that effectively wasted all of our time, (including the two whole intro classes) if the background mathematics is important, (again, I would venture that, to a non-expert-level general practitioner, which this class is aimed at, it's just not) move some of it out of this class and into some of the others so that we don't end up with effectively two important classes out of 9 - the Data Analysis with Python class, for being the most challenging mechanically, (i.e. what -exactly- should I be typing in at the command prompt to get what I want to happen) and this one, for being the most challenging theoretically.  Would very much like to see a re-work of the overall curriculum to better space out the effort vs time invested relationship.",3
1941,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Sean E B,"Oct 16, 2019","It's really not very good. It's extremely frustrating and poorly made. It barely helps equip you with any practical python machine learning knowledge.
 Good points:
Videos provide a good overview of the overall concepts and ideas
 The videos and quizes are logically set out
Bad points:
The practice notebooks contain a lot of code and information which is not explained and didn't really come up on the videos. Often, you do not know why the code is there, how to make it, or what it does. So you hardly get any practice using code for machine learning.
The final project is a joke. The instructions are not clear, insufficient, confusing, and contains grammatical/spelling mistakes. For example, the instructions for the final project as you to find values that are impossible for the type of model you're making. The course makers obviously just copied and pasted stuff and didn't check it. 
To make it worse, people have pointed out the mistakes and errors in the forums, but the course makers are either too lazy or don't care enough to fix it.
The forum is full of people asking for help and there is barely any clarification from the staff. 
  The course could be improved so much by having clearer and more instructions/annotations. However, it seems like IBM is satisfied ignoring the glaring problems present in the course.
 You money and time would be much better spend on another machine learning course. But if you're like me and have done the other (comparatively better) IBM data analysis courses i guess you have no choice but to do this one in order to get the final certificate.

1942,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Siavash A,"Nov 7, 2019","This course must be taken off from Coursera. Here is just a couple of reasons: There is very confusing typo and bad description of the final assignment, even though it has been reported, they didn't take 2 minutes to fix it. The final assignment is peer graded (which is really stupid, how do other clueless students know if I did it correctly or not) they provide an answer sheet (not the solution) and I think a lot of students thought it was the solution and marked my assignment incorrectly. The quality of the content provided is poor... If someone knows Python already, then they're wasting their time really, if they don't - this course does not teach them anything... Don't waste your time and money - there are much better options out there.  ",1

Everything was well explained and thorough meaning I did not get lost. The quizzes were challenging but fair. The final project was spot on and related perfectly with what has been learnt (unlike many other final projects in this specialization). Overall a very good experience.
The only constructive criticism I would give would be for the videos to give a quick overview/introduction of the code used in Python for the algorithms, which is then practiced in the labs. At the moment, the videos give an excellent explanation to everything but you don't see the actual code used until the lab.",5

I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".
Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)
Course 1: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 2: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 3: approximately 9 hours to complete
Course 4: approximately 22 hours to complete
Course 5: approximately 14 hours to complete
Course 6: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 7: approximately 16 hours to complete
Course 8: approximately 20 hours to complete
Course 9: approximately 47 hours to complete
This makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.

1984,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,kyleg907,"Apr 30, 2020","Its interesting given the title the lectures never mention Python or show code ; ) That's left to the ungraded exercises. I liked it this way. Getting the good background on the algorithms independent of language or library, and then applying that in the labs is effective. I will refer back to this class as I continue learning about ML. 
I had trouble getting my final project graded - but realized I hadn't shared my project correctly (at first didn't share code cells), and had to save a `version` of the notebook so my edits would be available to the other students to be graded. Leave yourself extra time for your peers to review your project, and check that the shared link to your notebook shows what you expect. You don't need to post in the forum to get your project graded - lots of students were doing that..",5
1985,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Gregory M,"Sep 14, 2022","This course took about a month longer than needed and this was due to factors out of my control. My IBM Cloud subscription reached its monthly allotted data allowance and IBM wanted $200 USD to get more space. So I am paying Coursera a monthly fee and then I am being asked for more money from IBM to have the ability to do what Coursera was asking me to do in the course.
I reached out to the instructor group about this issue and I was told to use the Skills Network Lab. This also cost me time because the Python that worked in IBM Cloud's Data Park did not cleanly line up with the Python version in the Skills Network Lab. This caused me to go back and rewrite portions of my final assignment. Again, costing me time for things that are not in my control.
My monthly fee to Coursera should be enough for me to do what is being asked of me in the course and it is ridiculous that this is not how Coursera views the situation. My ability to do the work at my convivence was a major factor in me deciding to do the IBM Data Science certificate course. Obviously this is a false narrative. 
In hindsight, I wish I never signed up for this certificate program. It has felt like a giant commercial for IBM products and then I actually got to the point to where they were overtly trying to milk more money out of me.

You can have a high enough overall grade that you could get a 0 on the final and still pass and still be out of luck if people decide to not help with grading, which is exactly what happened to me.

Week 3 was definitely heavy and challenging in the middle of it, but the course really builds up well and makes sense by the end of it and I understand why those topics were combined as they were.  I found the labs most helpful when they included # hashtag explanations/documentations when introducing new code to explain the different parameters and reasons for using them, or if establishing parameters in the code with explanatory definitions/names to guide the user through new operations.  In the very last lab, I think they included a link to the pandas API reference page with that specific new operation.

After the course, you will have a solid awareness of how machine learning is applied to the real world and how to use the skills like, sci-kit learn and SciPy from the Python language.

I definitely understand that you wasn't have hundreds taking the courses at any one time, so that might be the best way to get through the projects.  I hope that there is some sort of feedback loop so that if a project was failed by a classmate more than twice, the next submission goes to a REAL staff member for review.

One thing to be noted is that the algorithm training part totally in the practice session. So you have to first read/understand the code by yourself then you can implement it. I think the course could be better if video lectures where there for algorithm training part. ",5

1998,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Josh J,"Mar 1, 2023","Not bad. You definitely  need pre requisites beyond python. An understanding of numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Also although these are used in a lot of the code in this course they are never explained. In fact, many parameters are not explained and the authors of this course did their best job to explain things at a very high level of complication.  Not much in this course is broken down in simple terms which would have helped a great deal in terms of moving on to other subjects quicker.  You are left to decipher everything.I did the course in 5 weeks I scored a 90% on the final and I did the final optional lab and scored 53/53 100%. This course if authored better could be a 3 week course easily. The material is not that complicated once you break it down in a more relatable way which is once again most of the effort in this course. There are also many formulas presented in this course which you dont really need to know. A simple foot note of them would be enough but they are a large focal point for no good reason. The output that you end up creating in the labs is just different averages of the models you create. They dont show you how to output anything cool like actual predictions rather how well the model is performing. If your a tiny bit clever you can sort this out though but its not the focus which makes it way less fun. So to recap (My opinion):This course is not very fun. The material conceptually is really fun but you might never know from this course. The application of the material in this course could be very fun but in this course its not.  The explanations in this course could be fun and inspiring but they are instead rote and boring just like the labs. The positive aspect of this course is its kind of accredited you have something to show from your work, a certificate and there is a structure that you have to follow which helps. They claimed there would be projects that would help on a resume... not really at least nothing someone would be impressed by that didn't look super generic.",3
1999,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Erik C,"Jul 4, 2019","This was a good course to see how the basic ML models can be used with clear examples in Python.  It was a very good sequel to the Stanford as this course didn't go into detail on the algorithms or any depth in to the math behind the scenes.  In fact, you could ignore the equations and still do fine.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel I learned enough, specifically about how to tune the parameters and improve the results of different algorithms.  The final could be accomplished by simply cutting and pasting the work done in the non-graded 'labs' and providing any level of accuracy scores.  I would have welcomed more depth on optimization.  Also the hardest part of the course was using matplotlib but you didn't even need to understand it to pass.   Overall, I'm glad I took this course.  It was very helpful in my learning journey.",3
2000,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Shane W,"Jan 8, 2020","Actual content is good, but i deducted two stars. One star because the pacing of the course is just too fast. The course could really be split into two courses: one on regression and one on classification/clustering. I deducted the second star because the assignments really need to be clearer, especially the final assignment. It would greatly help the people doing the assignment *and the people grading it* if there were more explicit prompts for where you wanted to see, e.g. jaccard score for the knn model, or if you said, ""build a visualization that demonstrates the accuracy of knn models for all k, 0<k<20"". Being more explicit about the expectations would make the assignment a better evaluation of the student's understanding.",3
2001,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,D. D T,"Jul 9, 2019","The Machine Learning with Python course was very challenging.  The final assignment, though, seemed to require knowledge not yet learned, which made it rough to complete.

I restarted the kernels and re-ran my code a couple times and it was finally visible when I opened the shareable link.  That delayed my receipt of an accurate score for a few days. Ugh.",3

2006,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Farrukh N A,"Jul 16, 2020","I have just completed the course and mentioned below are my key pros and cons for this course:
Pros:
1) I loved the theory and different techniques explained in the course.
2) The presentations were very well made and it helped me to gain knowledge as far as ML is concerned.
Cons:
1) This is a pretty outdated course, where there are ALOT of typos and coding errors throughout the labs as the coder has left IBM and is working in some other company for more than a year now. Thats is why no one is there to update the course.
2) The title of the course should be ""Machine Learning with Mathematics"" rather than ""MAchine Learning with Python"" because the emphasis of this course is on using mathematics to solve ML related problems and that is why most of the libraries and techniques used in the python files were not defined.
3) This IBM's specialization is of BEGINNER level and the inclusion of an INTERMEDIATE level course which requires you have to have some experience in Data Science and advanced level knowledge of Python is just mind boggling to me. It would have been great if a basic level course of ML would have been developed which emphasized on explaining while using Python libraries would have been much more appropriate for us.
4) Lastly, it has confused me while going through this course that numerous times the lecturer spent major time of the lecture in explaining the advanced mathematics which  Pythons libraries can easily do for you, even if he told us that remembering of the mathematics is not need. STILL he explained it. I don't know why he did it again and again.",2
2007,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,F K,"May 17, 2020","I learned a lot from this course. However, had I known what I had to go through to learn the knowledge, I would not have taken the course; the process is too painful. Therefore I would not recommend the course to future learners. Read my review and save yourself $39.
1) Too many typos, bugs, inconsistencies throughout the videos and labs. The same mistakes have been brought up by students over and over again on the discussion forum, but have never been fixed.
2) Teaching staff do not pay attention to students asking for help. Sometimes when they do answer the question, they give a very vague or irrelevant answer; and when being pointed out by students that their answer is not helpful, the teaching staff do not bother to reply and address the issue. I feel like the teaching staff never went through the entire course themselves so they do not understand our students' concern and frustration.
3) A lot of Python codes are never explained or commented. This is a beginner level class but they expect you to be able to code proficiently; otherwise you are going to be stuck with one line of unexplained code for a long time...
4) The whole course is like a giant advertisement for IBM Cloud, which is not user-friendly at all.",2
2008,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Anton M,"Apr 29, 2020","A bit dissapointed by this course. The main topics were given clear and simple, but there were too few details, saying that all the details are out of scope of the course. But I would prefer to have more information and also more mathematical details (I find the argument that it needs appropriate background strange: if one wants to learn Machine Learning, should already have some basic mathematical background as knowledge of derivatives, integrals, etc).
Another big disappointment was absence of the graded programming assignments, except the final project. Every part of the course had just graded Quiz, but real hand-on scripting in python was given just as non-graded example, and then final assignment basically consisted from the same code.I find this approach quite useless. Also the final assignment had to be done at the IBM Watson website - I guess just for advertisement of IBM services - but this is useless to waste time on registering there, and figuring out how to do things there, if instead could be done inside coursera itself. 
And finally, there few some mistakes and typos e.g. in the final assignment, which made everything a bit confusing. ",2

I would have appreciated a much more in-depth look at the concepts or at least explaining them in further detail. These courses are supposedly for ""beginners"" but there is no way a ""beginner"" would be able to get through a course like this without explaining everything better.

The final project for this course did not have full enough instructions; the final bit had not been covered at all in earlier weeks and students are left with a generic instruction of 'you should be able to do x'...without any further guidance.

They have a system to report mistakes, but I should be getting paid to fix your course - not paying to fix it, right? The quizzes are an unnecessary waste of time (they ask very minute, arbitrary questions about videos that are just meant to give you a brief overview). 
The labs are the most / only useful aspect of the course because that's where you learn actual code - but they don't explain HOW the code WORKS. They just say what the code does and then they show it to you. There's a difference, as any good teacher knows. This course was clearly created by data scientists, not teachers (and certainly not masters of the English language).

Moreoever, the Final Assignment features an unbalanced dataset, for which the course does not prepare students enough.

Quite simply, this course was brilliant because not only did it bring everything we've learned so far together but it also built upon the last course and properly introduced us to Machine Learning and its applications. In his videos, Saeed successfully breaks down complex topics into digestible byte-sized content and ensures that you intuitively understand what is going on. 
One of the best pieces of advice I have received in regards to my learning and in life in general is to make sure you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and these become building blocks to much more complex topics. That in a nutshell is what I believe this course has done for me.

2038,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Pablo F,"Jul 2, 2023","Machine Learning with Python is a comprehensive guided path into the insights of Machine Learning.  Machine Learning, a term of relatively recent appearance, it is actually utilizing mathematical analysis that dates even centuries ago.  Linear regression, logistic regression, are based on mathematical theories with a long history. This particular course, introduce the subject in a clear and comprehensive way suited for all audience with little background on this mathematical theorems.  And for those who had the knowledge from previous academic courses of practical experience, the course in very helpful as it allows to refresh the concept in a dynamic and easy to follow pace, in my opinion. ",5
2039,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,S.M.Abid R,"Jan 1, 2021","The best way to succeed in this course is to when doing the labs, write down with ""hand"" every line of code on a separate place, though, you will not understand most of it, just keep going. And then type it on Jupyter notebook from ""hand written notes"". This process might seem hard effort or seems like no learning is there but trust me this process will get you break the thick wall of Machine Learning and python code. The rest will follow. After following the process, I feel very familiar with code, machine learning algorithms and terminologies which I guess is big achievement. I also believe ISLR can help later in understanding these algos and set up more solid foundation.",5
2040,Machine Learning with Python by IBM,Ahmed S,"Oct 19, 2020","Certainly a great course, clear voice and visuals in which the concepts have been explained clearly with rich details. I have noticed many are complaining about the math, lab, coding and the conceptual explanations; so here is a reminder than the course strongly suggested a 'background in Python programing language' in the beginning. Additionally, this is an 'intermediate/ advanced' course for engineers and data scientists, so a well-established knowledge in math should've been already acquired by default, even though the math needed here is very basic and can be done automatically.  Also, understanding the conceptual part is very important to perform tasks correctly.",5

The course DOES NOT provide any support to prepare ""beginners"" for that project. In fact, some people withdrew from the course in anger over this.

What Duke should do is provide a demonstration of how to do that work, whether in Excel or Google or any other tool. I had NO IDEA how to begin. So I spent literally hours looking for videos that demonstrated it. I persevered and got it done, but I think Duke should do more for people who are paying for this. 

It is really unfortunate to do all that course work and then withdraw at the every end because you lack the support and guidance to complete the final project.

PLEASE pass this on to Jon Reifschneider. ",4
2334,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,Michael H,"Nov 1, 2022","This is a really good course that provides a solid overview of machine learning and some of the primary methods for doing so. As a product manager, I would say there should be a little less math in the lectures because it distracts from the essence of what you are trying to teach. Overall, a very good course.",4
2335,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,Maureen K,"Sep 3, 2023","Not a bad course but I'm not sure how this it relates to Product Management, aside from some industry examples in the content. For my knowledge level, this was way too dense. Loads of formulas and modeling that I'll never use. The course lost me when it started writing out mathematic equations.  I'm finishing the course because of sunk cost bias but would not take it again seeing how the content does not match up with any area of my job.",3
2336,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,Justin S,"Apr 6, 2024","Interesting course with a lot of potential, but 3 major feedback points soured it for me: 
1. Although this course is explicitly ""for Product Managers"" in its title, there is no mention of product management or anything specifically relevant to PMs in the entire course. It is really more of a generalist course for anyone. Had I known this, I would have more fully evaluated the complete ML foundations course landscape. 
2. The AutoML platform recommended for the final project was sunset by Google, and there's no helpful guide to using VertexAI as its replacement. I and other students (based on the forums) have spent hours and hours trying to debug Vertex errors to no avail. 
3. Week 6 suddenly and unnecessarily goes very hardcore into math and calculus relating to neural networks in a very fast pace, without actually explaining or teaching what any of it means.",2
2337,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,Peter V,"Nov 11, 2023","The course itself was quite good, a thorough introduction to machine learning. So why the two stars? For the final project, the course offers three possible methods: programming in Python, via VBA in Excel, or using Google Cloud AI. The first two were not an option for me, as I do not code. What I wish I knew was that, in order to make Google Cloud feasible, I would have to spend hundreds of dollars on hosting the (relatively modest) dataset. The course description was not at all clear about this.",2

2347,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,George K,"Feb 12, 2024",I found the course for the most part to be interesting and beneficial in establishing a foundational knowledge of ML... however this does not come without some issues. The primary issue I had with this course is the peer reviewed assignment. In my view it should not be an assignment for this course which is clearly title and targeted for Product Managers. The assignment would be more applicable in a different course that branched off into developing the technical acumen of ML and not in what seems to be a foundational course for PM. This course is not written by PMs for PMs but rather by ML Engineers for ML/Computer Science Engineers looking to become PMs. Additionally a peer reviewed assignment in this context presents no real value as most people cannot provide SME valued feedback.,4

It's left up to you to figure out how to create and interpret the models with your chosen tools and as someone with a basic understanding of statistical modelling, I spent hours trying to understand how to do this.

The option was to do the project in Excel or with Google AI. I would have loved some short instructions on how to get Vertex AI going. The instructions were for AutoML which has been retired.

2438,Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers by Duke University,Siddharth,"Jan 18, 2024","I was eager to take this course to expand my knowledge of machine learning fundamentals and applications as a product manager. Overall, I found the course to be a valuable introduction to key machine learning concepts and algorithms.

The instructor clearly has deep expertise in the field and I appreciated how he used real-world examples to illustrate the material. His lectures were engaging and he effectively conveyed complex topics in an accessible way. I also liked that the course provided opportunities to get hands-on experience through the final project.

My main suggestion would be to consider expanding the curriculum to add more depth on supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. While I recognize the course aims for a broad overview, slightly more rigor would help differentiate it and better prepare students to apply these techniques. 

That said, I understand the challenges of balancing breadth and depth in a short course. The topics covered do provide a solid foundation to build upon. I particularly valued the practical guidance on evaluating and interpreting models - an area where product managers need to collaborate effectively with technical teams.

To fully prepare product managers for applying machine learning, I believe the course would benefit from more in-depth coverage of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. I posit that adding another course, or two that adds greater depth to all things Supervised, and Unsupervised learning in this course could make this course not just stand out, but also transform it to being the go-to course for anyone wanting to become an AI PM. Also, consider adding another module in the intro course to cover algorithms like support vector machines and Naive Bayes to make it more complete. Incorporating 5-6 hands-on guided projects using the methods covered would also let students get critical hands-on experience applying the concepts. With these enhancements, the course could become the definitive destination for aspiring AI PMs to build a strong foundation beyond surface-level ML literacy. That said, I appreciate the quality of instruction and see this as constructive feedback for an already valuable introductory course.

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining core ML literacy as a product manager. The instructor and content are excellent for an introductory survey course. I believe expanding on a few areas could make it an even more comprehensive offering and stellar resource for aspiring AI product managers. Please take my suggestions as constructive feedback to an already strong course. I appreciate the quality of instruction and look forward to learning more!",3

Not how to build a model. Yet here I am at the last 10% needed to pass the course and I am asked to build a ML model. It's like showing someone a built house in some details and telling them to go buy the tools, the materials and build a house. I simply don't have the resources and knowledge or experience needed. The course certainly didn't provide the necessary tools even after 6 weeks of work. 

Before I started, I specifically checked who this course was for, what prerequisites and experience was needed to pass and I was told no experience was necessary. Google's course on the other hand offers the same table des matières course but they list their prerequisites and prework necessary to actually complete their course.

2447,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,Olivia K,"Dec 18, 2020","There was not enough, by far, information on teaching you even the basics on using Cognos. Out of the four weeks for this course, with the fourth week being your final exam, only week three is dedicated to Cognos, and I had a LOT of questions that weren't answered. This should be re-named ""Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Introduction to Cognos"". ",2
2448,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,William L,"Jan 14, 2021","Many basic functions not taught, many terms not taught but referred too in hands on models, hands on models were missing key steps to complete, student must complete many steps not shown and it becomes very time consuming, this classes should be reviewed and updated",2
2449,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,Bijan A,"Jul 8, 2021","Although the course has a lot to offer, but the outdated videos are hard to follow, because the IBM Cognos has changed some of the interfaces since the videos were created and it makes it very hard to follow as a hands on course to learn. The videos can also  dramatically improve, by offering more examples, and also they were recorded like TV commercials, very fast moving on screens which they needed to be more gradual for the students to follow. Unfortunately the support for this course wasn't good at all, either the support personnel didn't have the inadept knowledge of the products specially IBM Cognos, or they refused to provide educational support to help us resolve problems. The support was more like the Uber support rather than the one expected from an organization like IBM. 
Before taking this course I was so excited to learn all I could about the IBM Cognos. but I had to learn everything on my own at a very slower pace than I usually do. It is a shame that a course offered as part of a certification program which introduces a powerful tool which is also made by the  same company, is butchered so badly . 
Please review all the course materials and update them appropriately and hire some professional people with knowledge and patience to properly address the course shortcoming's which are a lot. ",1
2450,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,Derek N,"May 3, 2021","Nothing more than a hidden advertisement for IBM Cognos, and from what I saw, probably the only way to attract new users to it. Poorly finished product, inability to control critical elements of visualization. No PDF export, just to name one of many many aspects missing or poorly finished. The course work that relates to Cognos is little more than a run though of the 'features'. In the end you will not know how best to prepare your data for Cognos, but you will know how to generate a 1930' dashboard ... Fallout anyone?",1

All of the instructions and images are based off of an older version of Cognos which is very confusing. Additionally, the instructions just tell you where to click without ever explaining why any of the options are selected. The only thing that this course teaches is how to follow directions, not necessarily how to utilize the tools presented.",1

2459,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,Rik,"Sep 16, 2022","Absolutely dreadful. The Excel componant was interesting, and well put together. And dare I say it informative and interesting. The Cognos half was absolutely dreadful. Out of date tutorials that did not relate to the technology used and labs which did not function at all because they were not updated. A final assessment that did not draw on taught knowledge. And a presentation that was entirely oh yeah heres some things that I think are cool seemingly narrated by some student they dragged in off the streets who had no interest in what he was doing and was just in show off mode showcasing tricks he had learnt and things he thought were cool rather than actually you know teaching. No core learning, no thought given to the learner, just glossing over anything that might be useful with tons of information left out. The only reason I learnt anything was that the units were so bad I had to go googling to actually find out what it was the course should have taught me. In fact the Cognos units were so bad they only thing they left in my mind was a determintation to never use Cognos again. Also lets talk about the fact all software is provided for this course. Really? Because i gott say that a 30 day free trial is not free software, that is forcing a deadline on you that you might not be able to adhear to.  Whats that you say the Cognos software has a special trial linked back to this course? No it does not. It might have had once upon a time but those days are long long gone. Just the course has not been updated to frelect it. Also the grading is crazy. Despite attaining 100% in everything I recieved a grade of 96%.

2500,Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos by IBM,Yo'Av D,"Jun 24, 2021","Good overall, but of much lesser quality than the first two courses in the Data Analyst certification program.
The Cognos bit was sort of rushed, and even though the labs provided guidance for the How-Tos, the Whys and Whats weren't always clear.
As for the Excel portion, the material was important and useful. However, while I understand why the labs are designed for the Web version, I think there should be greater emphasis on teaching how to accomplish the same tasks using the Desktop version too, because it's hard to say in advance what kind of version learners would proceed to work with. On several tasks, I noticed significant differences between Desktop and Web (I use Office 365), and even on the final assignment, I had to divide the work between the the two versions, because not all features were available to me in one (I first created the charts I need the Desktop version for, and then uploaded the workbook to Web to finish the assignment there with the features I could only use there).
Both Cognos and Excel bits should be updated to reflect current terminology and layouts. On multiple occasions, I found myself looking at something that didn't match the instructions, only to realize that feature had been moved or renamed.
As for the peer-assessment, please consider it mandatory for reviewers to leave a comment to explain if they dock points - I'm always happy to give full marks where applicable, but I also leave a comment to explain what was missing if I rate it anything less than the maximum (I had a strange experience with someone docking random points off my assignment with no explanation, forcing me to resubmit and wait for a second opinion, only to then receive an almost-perfect score).",4

The only problem I encountered was with their support. For half a month, I couldn't access  IBM Cognos and other lab instructions and thus couldn't complete the course.

I believe the quizzes should cover the more important concepts presented in the videos rather than trivial details. What I truly dislike is the fact that there is no interaction with actual instructors. The final assignment is graded by peers and absolutely no feedback is given to explain their rationale for choosing a particular value on the assessment rubric. I suppose I should be happy with a 90 on the final assignment, but I should have made 100%.

One of the overall issues with Coursera learning is that once you pass an exam, if you do not score 100%, there is no option to reveal the correct answers to the questions you did get wrong. This limits understanding. Of course, if you choose to reveal the answers, then you should not be able to take the exam again. There could be a pop-up, asking you to accept this term. If you get a 70% and pass, then once you see the answers, your 70% is locked in and cannot be changed. ",4

However, I cannot rate it higher that 2 stars for a very important reasons: Big Parts of the Final peer-reviewed assignment are not even covered in the course!!! I had to scour the internet and find my own solutions (and many others clearly had the same problem as seen in the discussions section). This is a big problem and needs to be addressed as we should be tested on the material actually learnt!
Also, almost every video repeats how the data is 'cleaned' which is good once or twice, but unnecessary the 15th time.",2

2651,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Jake L,"Jan 24, 2019","I did not like that some assignments do no rely on the material that was given in the course. For example, data visualisation with Artist layer was not covered in details in the course and you have to spend tons of time on Internet digging out how to implement that. This is a waste of time, I need a course that gives me complete and structured info, not a course that sends me out to explore the Internet.",1
2652,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Nils W,"Mar 27, 2019","It is a strange course and the worst in this specialisation so far. In one week 50% of the video is how the data is prepared. That would be ok if it won´t be the same video snippet 4 times. Also the relation of video vs. reading is 1 to 6. In one week is only 6 minuites of Video and about 1 h of ungraded assignment. 
The final assignment isn´t solvable with the given code or examples. It is ok that one had to google for code snippets, but this is far too much.",1

2655,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Karel H,"Sep 3, 2019",Final exam was frustrating.  It took longer to complete than the rest of the course combined.  Questions were included that were not part of the course including the need to reset keys.  Peer review was almost impossible since I could not read the tiny screen shots very well.,4
2656,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Ismael S,"Jun 5, 2019","The course is very inconsistent, it repeats the same one minute in all of the videos, when reviewing the dataframe. Many times some things are asked without providing previous explanation, and the final assignment is also an example, I had to search all over internet to resolve it, because I couldn't find any reference in the content provided.",1
2657,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Andrew T,"Jul 8, 2020","Compared to other courses in the IBM Professional Certification catalog, this course has some noticeable deficiencies.
First, the overall content of the course rather confusing.  The very first lecture focuses around efficient 'less-is-more' figure design, which I certainly agree with.  However, much of the course (and most of the tested material) focuses on making extraneous graphics such as waffle charts and chloropleth maps in situations where a simple bar graph would be the most efficient way to present data.  Meanwhile, the standard module Seaborn (which is EXTREMELY expansive in data visualization utility) is given only a single 2 minute lecture.  
Second, unlike all other courses I have taken in the IBM certification, the assignments and workshop sections of this course are largely unhelpful.  In addition to my point above, the workshops focus on manipulating aesthetics of simple graphics (i.e. changing colors in a bar graph)  as opposed to showcasing the broad number of figures that Python is capable of generating.  This left me disappointed with what I took away from the course in terms of usable knowledge.
Finally, the final assignment is arduous and poorly documented.  There is no structured notebook that provides guidance on solving the problems, which is particularly troublesome when rendering uncommon figures such as chloropleth maps.  I found that I spent >80% of my time on the assignment chasing down unintelligible error messages, as opposed to developing a real understanding of the logic behind generating graphics in Python.  
The majority of other courses in the IBM certification have been very well designed and educational, I just feel that this one in particular has a lot of room for improvement. ",2
2658,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Baidi W,"Jun 10, 2019",I would give zero if the system has. An empty course that you almost cannot learn anything especially when you're going to practice. ,1
2659,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Roger S P M,"Dec 29, 2018",The course material is not sufficient for completing the final graded assignment. It required many hours of internet research to collect the details necessary for the final graded assignment. ,2
2660,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Yuanyuan J,"Jan 24, 2019",The course materials are poorly structured. Labs are not well-designed and not friendly to students with little experience. This is not a very effective course.,1
2661,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Thomas S,"Apr 13, 2020","I felt that the curriculum was not structured in a manner conducive to learn the material. Too much of the training and lab work was to execute already prepared commands without an explanation as to why we were doing using these commands. In addition, the training material could have used more detailed explanations and then lab work allowing the student to apply this knowledge. Instead, you watch a lot of abbreviated videos and then do a single lab exercise that has the student try out certain aspects of what was covered.
For the final exercise, there was so much that wasn't covered in the course material. This took many extra hours searching for how to do things. While this type of searching might have been helpful in preparing for use of Python/Data Science outside of the course, none of the course material to date trained us on how to interpret the reference material. The final lab should be challenging, but not to the extent where the material presented doesn't provide the method for solving these problems. The curriculum designer should take this into account when building these classes.
Lastly, the tooling used for the course did not work for over a month. This added hours to my training. It also meant that I was never able to complete some of the lab exercises, or use the completed material as a reference for the final exam work. The Coursera help desk was not at all helpful in informing students of the issue and when it would be resolved, and only gave advice to try to recreate the same exercises (without the supporting code) in other environments. This added many hours to the time that I needed to complete the exercise.",1

There were plenty of topics covered that could have formed a challenging final project without asking us to do things that we weren't equipped to do by the course. Fortunately, I was able to find what I needed but after putting all of that work into the course and labs, I shouldn't have had to spend as many hours on the final project as I did. If those are things I needed to know, then the content was inadequate. If I didn't need to know those things, the project was poorly created.",2
2663,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Clinton,"Jun 21, 2019","so far ive spent the most time on this course . This course has around the shortest estimated time to complete. The number of discussions in week 3 is around 5 times more than the Python for Data Analysis course.... why we may ask?
The plotting of views are overly dependent on syntax. The information gain in trying to figure out that syntax is negative, i.e. up until this course i was enjoying my first experience with python. 12 hours later, i cant get a chloropleth chart to work because something as minor as  column orders were incorrect. Very frustrating!

I liked how the labs really explored different options and played around with the code in a variety of ways to show a more complete picture of what the code instances can do.  I especially liked how sometimes the labs would purposely use incorrect code which users might enter, and then explain why that code didn't apply or work for given scenarios.  
I liked how the videos (specifically regarding Canada dataset) would repeat the cleansing of the data and introduction of the data for each type of plot because it really reinforced the concept, however it could have been better if the corresponding code were displayed alongside its effects instead of just showing its effects because then it would drive home the code and the concept instead of just the concept.
I also liked the fact that the final project asked students to make connections beyond the individual class scope, as a way of teaching that mimics real-world projects and learning.",5
2675,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Hani H,"Apr 4, 2022","This course started out good but quickly went downhill. The first two weeks focused on matplotlib, and while I did learn something useful, I did not need a dataset recap on every single video. its a waste of time.
Week three is where things quickly go off the rail. Waffle charts were introduced, and we were told that there is no quick way to do a waffle chart in python. That's fine, I'll learn how to do it the old school way. That was time consuming but time well spent right? WRONG. When you take the module quiz you are asked if  pyWaffle is the best way to create a waffle chart. You answer no because you actually watched the videos and did the lab training, but you get a wrong answer.  You check online and what do you know, you can actually do a waffle chart with 2 lines of code. IBM knew this (hense the question in the quiz) but nobody bothered to update the lab or the videos
The video on word clouds introduces the concept and you were supposed to learn in in the lab, but then you get to the lab and you are told to skip this section. I have no words for this
The part on dashboards takes the cakes. IBM basically provides you with external links and leaves it at that, there isnt even an attempt to teach you these concepts. And you know what the best part is? the course project requires you to build a dashboard. Yep, the thing they didnt even attempt to teach you.
Anyway this review is too long and I doubt anyone reads it, but hey, if you do, just be prepared to read a ton of external resources because you are not getting what you are promised",2
2676,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,David A,"Oct 22, 2019","While I enjoyed the content of this course, I feel that the instruction was disorganized.  This course is part of a beginner sequence in data science, but the teacher assumes certain advanced skills are already known and does not teach them.  For example, chart annotation is only briefly covered in the second lab, but the final assignment requires a depth of knowledge not taught in this course.  If that's the case then chart annotation should be taught as its own section.  A lot of the quizzes are written to trick you with ambiguous phrases, rarely do they actually test what is learned in the labs.  I think the teaching in the other IBM data science courses is far better than this one, hopefully they improve this one.  ",1

I wish it explored pros/cons of advanced visualization techniques & how to go about implementing them in python with several real-world examples. The videos were extremely short & repetitive explaining the same dataset in each video. Bulk of the learning happens in optional labs & peer reviewed final assignment. Most of the insights are easily available online.,1
2679,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Paul B,"Mar 1, 2020",Like other reviews I was really looking forward to this course in the IBM syllabus but was very disappointed. Videos were very high level and repetitive - and there were a lot of them. The detail in the exercises was better but there were significant challenges in getting them to work. And then the final assignment was a bit of a joke. The visualisations you were expected to produce had not been taught in the course and as you'll see from the forums requires a lot of work arounds. I would suggest this course needs a bottom up re-write. Do less but cover it better!,2
2680,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,MAJ A S,"Jun 22, 2020","There's a lot of good material, and ultimately enough to integrate into successive work in data science. 
On the frustrating side, most of the explanations focused on ""what"" rather than ""why"", and there's so many ""why"" left unanswered when choosing to address a problem with these tools. 
Additionally, most of the questions were either insultingly easy or incredibly difficult. Plenty of googling in addition to reviewing presented material.",2
2681,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Andrea V,"Jun 11, 2023","I found this module of the Data Science Professional Certificate to be quite disappointing. 
The videos were too short, repetitive (same data processing in every video) and lacked the depth of explanation required to get a good grasp on the material. Everything felt rushed and superficial. 
There was use of more advanced Python code without a gradual preparation towards tackling more difficult concepts and syntax. For example, building a 'waffle chart' from scratch in Python seemed a bit out of the scope of this course. Since there are more than 40 charts available in Matplotlib, what is the point of using an entire Lab session going over the complex code required (at least in my humble opinion) to build a very specific type of graph. I found it would have been more useful to explain the process of selecting the right graph for the right type of data and how to highlight the insight we want to draw on the data. 
On top of that, all of a sudden the course shifted into building web applications with Dash. Again little to no explanation or preparation about the code being used, just 'copy and paste' these lines of code and there you have it. 
Overall, my understanding is that the libraries addressed in this module are not quite complex and required quite some time to be explained properly. The suggested time required to complete each section seemed quite unrealistic given the breadth and depth of skills/understanding needed to use these Python libraries successfully.",1

This course was unique in the Data Science Professional Certificate Progression in that the content of the videos was not very helpful, making your rely on the labs to teach yourself.  
The labs were not great in walking you through all the parameters that were available for each type of plot, and while you can copy and paste solutions and tinker to learn things, the course didn't leave me with a good understanding of how or why things work and thus, unable to apply solutions creatively and appropriately without much effort.

2689,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Ian A T,"May 8, 2020","While the data visualization tools outlined here are valuable, the final assignment for this course does a very poor job of assessing the things that were actually taught.
Early on, you are assured that the course will emphasize the scripting layer of matplotlib, rather than the more complex artist layer. In the final assignment, however, you are instructed to use the artist layer, and configure many parameters that were never covered in any of the labs or videos.
Likewise, utilizing geojson files for choropleth maps was covered in the most cursory manner - you are never requried to open a geojson file, or understand how it is configured. You just load it in and carry on with the assignment. However, without understanding the setup of a geojson file, no student is going to understand how to properly configure the key_on parameter when making their own choropleth map for the final assignment.
The ability to actually create a graph from a set of data is perhaps the smallest part of the final assessment. Everything else is fussing with irritating details, often details that we were never taught about in class.",1

I would have liked to see more of the possible implementations as opposed to manipulation of the aesthetic.  I also hoped they would cover seaborn in more detail.
Although most people are against the final assignment, I actually enjoyed it as the previous courses gave us a jupyter notebook with most of the work already done, only letting us write the main part of the code.

All videos had a same part that was repeated, and no information was agregated by this repetition.
The contents of the labs are quite good, but a more detailed explanation could exist.
Some updates are needed: one of the labs uses MapBoxBright, which gives us a clean figure with no map because this is not available anymore.
The final assignment required us to look for solutions that were not present in the course, and in my opinion, they should be. The student should go to outside sources when it feels a need to understand something deeply or if the way presented by the instructors was not the best for the student to understand what's going on.
There's a lot of room for improvement: the videos should not be repetitive; the contents should be updated, anything that is required in the assignment should be presented throughout the course, if it's not in the labs it should at least be in the videos; the final assignment could provide a notebook with the requirements as the other courses in the specialization offer (in my case, I took it as part of Data Science Professional Certificate by IBM); if this is not the case, the student should be prompted to create a notebook with the questions and answers, which would estimulate even more the creativity around data visualization.",3
2764,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Farrukh N A,"Jul 1, 2020","I hold a degree in computer sciences with majors in Software Engineering so please take this review of the course seriously.
Unfortunately, this is the only course where it seems the teacher never had any outline as to what he needs to teach and how.
1) He has made the video lectures useless as he declared himself that the videos will be short but you have to 'read' lines and lines of lectures to get a grasp of the visualizations he will teach. I think he don't know if it was that easy for a person to get knowledge then he would have just read text books and would have gotten the degree as according to him there wouldn't be any need to educational institutions.
2) Many times, he introduces many 'advanced' functions of Python which was not taught in the previous course which was about Data Analysis by Python. I don't have any problem in learning new things everyday but using multiple advanced functions in a 'beginner' course makes it tough for student to grasp what he was trying to teach.
3) There are far better and easier ways to do many things but it seems he deliberately uses long, tedious and advances methods for plotting various graphs and makes things confusing again and again.
4) Lastly, he himself gives advanced quizzes for the stuff which were not even taught extensively and it makes hard to even pass them.",3
2765,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Boris B,"Oct 22, 2022","Die Inhalte des Kurses stellen knapp einzelne relevante Phythonbibliotheken zur Datenvisualisierung vor und führen gelungen in diese ein. Leider ist das Final Asignment eine didaktische Katastrophe. Bei mir war das vorbereitet Dashboard an mehreren Stellen fehlerhaft, so dass die im Asignment angeforderten Screenshots nur dann erstellt werden konnten, wenn man neben den gestellten Aufgaben auch die Fehler behbt.
Da wäre zum Einen ein bereits im Forum diskutiertet Fehler der auf dem Parsing eines strings -> int beruht. Zum anderen wurde die colour : 'Flights' nicht als Property des ugehörigen Feldes erkannt. Das sind Dinge, die bereits bei der Konzeption des Asignments hätte feststellen können, wenn man die Aufgabe einmal selbst durchspielt.
Zum Anderen standen die Anzahl der angeforderten Scrennshots dieses Assignments nur in geringem Zusammenhang mit der des Absolventen erbrachten Leistung innerhalb der Aufgabe. Ich habe mehr Zeit damit verbraht sie Screenshots anzufertigen, als dass ich für das eigentliche Assignment benötigt habe. In anderen Assignments habe ich erlegt, dass man einfach den ""Code"" der Aufgabe reviewen und dabei diesen mit den Ergebnissen abgleichen sollte.

2766,Data Visualization with Python by IBM,Vladimir,"Sep 1, 2023","This course is overloaded and doesn't teach well.
After having tons of examples you will end up with tasks where you have solution available in hint or even as part of your code skeleton. I wonder how people fail to pass the task reviews. Or they just can't read?
Questions in quizes and exams are like ""who is the author of the library?"" Does it really matter in such a course?
Some other questions are checking that you have heard a couple of words properly during this 5-week course. Don't you want to ask about the visuals? What about the code in Python?
Wording in tasks is often a disaster. E. g. a pie chart is based on a total advertisement expenditures but it is called ""Total Sales"". Who are you trying to cheat, my dear data scientist?
Some tasks are even missed in task statement, but you will be asked for their results later, with no idea what to answer.
What is never missed during the course, though, is that you must assign labels and titles to your plots. No matter how accurate is your plot, what was the task and even if you don't have the task, they will remind you on every page that you must set the labels.

Very few explanations are given about the whole subject and it is strange that the final assignment is based on this when we had many other things to work with that were better explained and detailed. 
There are several errors in the given code in the final assignment and, assuming that everyone here is a junior and/or has their first contact with programming language through this course, it should have been tested better. Not all people have the expertise to turn around the issues when trying to run the application. I'm lucky because everyone in my house is familiar with programming language so I decided to get help from here, instead of sending messages, print screens, and whatsoever to have an answer just one day later.
Furthermore, please, stop with the print screens' way of evaluating. It is time-consuming. It would be better if there was a way to just send a link to showcase our work.

In the final assignment, I had to explore the internet to get some codes to display the bar graph or the map. These codes were not covered in the class. The course needs to get improved by giving the keys of how to do things . For instance, the method .patches was never covered in the course. I do not know how to use it. It may be a part of panda library, but the method was critical to do the assignment. There are many other examples. I spent almost a night to finish the assignment because I took a long time to self learn these tasks. It is good at one side, but the course should help me.

2897,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,Oleh S,"Aug 3, 2020"," This course is more mature than the first one. Materials are very interesting and provide nice intuition for the probabilistic models. One can study the basics of auto-correction, Markov and Hidden Markov Models as well as the N-gram models and very important approach - Word2Vec, which is the essential part of the modern deep learning algorithms. I really enjoyed this part. 
However, there are some minor suggestions: 
1. Lectures duration could be longer - it will help to provide more depth in materials in both math and code side. I know that this is a simple version of real academic course, but in order to increase the quality you should consider the increasing duration;
2.  Programming assignments are not balanced and there are still some minor ambiguities. For instance, the first and HMM assignments are tough, whereas the last one is a piece of cake.
3. The course can be enhanced with the additional part dedicated to Probability Theory, maybe a few lectures more.
I recommend this course to everyone interested in NLP. Note, you should read and study the additional resources to reinforce  your knowledge, here is just the starting point for a good researcher. Keep going, guys!

There seemed to be little or no TA support. Many people were posting questions and not receiving answers from TAs. I posted the mistakes I identified in the course content, but I don't think anyone is going to act on this. It would have been good if the last exercise were repeated in Tensorflow. Also it would have been good to actually use the embeddings for something in the last exercise. From the PCA graph, the embeddings looked pretty poor. ",4

This one, however, has a lot of bugs (like when I finished week 1, quiz was or may be still is from week 4), quizes are just repetitions of questions from lectures (even answers are the same). 
Also, all of the weeks except week 4 is more about programming in python, than NLP. Even the last week assignment is more about writing basic backprop for simple shallow network, than working with embeddings.
Assignments are too easy, splitting every topic in 5 minutes video makes it easier to watch, however I think this format does not allows providing a lot of details on topic, so in the end I feel like this course is to shallow for a 4 week course.",2

Although it taught me a little bit of implementation, but for me the implementation is just cherry on top as these things can easily be googled. So, It would have a better impact if it also teaches the concepts/thinking behind these algorithm so that I can re-use its underlying idea. Overall, it is good course to get started.",3

The assignments are long and complex, with insufficient checks to debug when there's an error.  The theory is poorly explained in both the videos and the labs. They clearly do not know who this course is aimed at; is it software engineers who want to better understand NLP? In which case they may find the assignments easy but the content lacking. Is it people with a basic understanding of NLP but want to take it further? In which case they will not get that, given that the concepts are only briefly discussed. Is it as a general introduction to NLP? In which case the coding aspect is at too high a level, you have to be familiar with all the little python tricks they know and to think in the same way they do. This leads to a frustrating experience.
By hovering the cursor over the names of contributors in the discussion forums, it is clear that most of the people who start this course never finish it. This level of attrition reflects poorly on the course creators.",2
2910,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,P G,"Oct 26, 2021","This course is unfortunately a waste of time. The lectures could be compressed into a 60 min video on basics of NLP with probabilistic models and uploaded to YouTube. You will feel initially like you learned a lot of things, yes, but then quickly forget this knowledge as everything is rushed and touched only superficially and you didn't develop solid understanding.
Also, the videos have to be revamped and recorded by someone a bit better in delivering lectures. The lecturer reads a script in a monotone voice and doesn't engage the learner. It feels like sitting through a boring slideshow at work rather than learning SOTA AI stuff from the world's leading tech institution...

2920,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,Kravchenko D,"Aug 21, 2020","Nice course, but assignments in this course are less practical than in the first course of this specialization. The last assignment in this course was implementing the word embeddings generation using your own neural network. The whole process of writing your own neural network is nice except the resulting word embeddings that look very bad and ungrouped on the plot and the text in the notebook says: ""You can see that woman and queen are next to each other. However, we have to be careful with the interpretation of this projected word vectors"" without an explanation of what's wrong with the results.

Week 1: Autocorrect and Minimum Edit Distance is OK, nothing to write home about but gives you a sense of how a basic autocorrect mechanism works and introduces dynamic programming.
Week 2: Part of Speech Tagging explains Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm pretty well. More of a sense here of learning something that will be a useful foundation.
Week 3: Autocomplete and Language Models explains what a language model is and builds a basic N-gram language model for autocompleting a sentence. Again, good foundations.
Week 4: Word embeddings with neural networks was for me the most interesting part of the specialization so far. The amount of lecture & lab content is considerably higher than in the previous weeks (which is a good thing in my view). The pros and cons of different ways of representing words as vectors are discussed, then different ways of generating word embeddings, from research papers dating from 2013 to 2018. The rest of the week focuses on implementing the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model for learning word embeddings with a shallow neural network. The whole process, from data preparation to building & training the network and extracting the embeddings, is explained & implemented in Python with NumPy, which is quite satisfying.
I found that the labs and assignments worked flawlessly. They are largely paint-by-numbers though, I would have liked to have been challenged and made to think more. The teaching is pretty good, though there's room for improvement. It tends to focus a little narrowly on the specific topic being covered and has the feel of reading a script. What I would like to see is more stepping back, thinking about and explaining the larger context of how the topic fits into current NLP and the student's learning journey; then engaging with the learner on this basis. I did feel this course was a little better than course 1 in that regard. Overall 4.5 stars but as there are no half stars, I'm going to let week 4 tip it up to 5.",5
2930,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,Yuri C,"Dec 30, 2020","I enjoyed very much this second course in the NPL specialization! I must say, once again the balance between mathematical formalism and hands-on coding is just on point! This is also not easy to achieve. I quite enjoyed also the infographics about the word embedding model developed during the course. I have been reading blog posts and papers about the technique for some time now and I did not see any best explanation than the one in this course, chapeau! Nevertheless, there are also points of improvement to consider. One of my main concerns is that at the end of some assignments, there is very little discussion about the validity and usefulness of what we get at the end. Although in the motivation a lot is being put forward. For example, while building the autocomplete, there were a lot of time dedicated to motivating why is this useful and why one should learn, but at the very end of the week, when we finally build one with tweeter data, there is very little analysis on these results. This is a bit frustrating. Of course, one cannot build very useful models while in an assignment in a Jupyter notebook, nevertheless I am positive that you can find also here a good balance between analyzing the model's outputs and inquiring if indeed we achieved the goal we set at the beginning, and if no, why not, etc. Clearly, assignments are not research papers, but a bit more careful treatment on that end will make this course achieve its full potential. Keep up the good work!",5
2931,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,John Y,"Dec 8, 2021","I really enjoyed the first two courses so far.  I finished the DL Specialization before I took this NLP sequence.  I'm glad that they tended to focus on the basic and essential concepts and not on the details too much like data cleaning although they do show you how these things are done too.  But there are really a lot of things to digest.  These courses can potentially fit into semesters in school but I think they successfully covered the important materials well.  I especially enjoyed learning new things like hashing, dynamic programming, and Markov models.  I found the labs to be very helpful because they helped divide the amount of material to digest into smaller portions.  I also found them very helpful for the homework.  Although some people didn't like the short videos, I actually liked them.  They were mostly to the point and they were easier for me to review.  People comment that they miss Andrew Ng's lecture.  Unfortunately, I don't think Andrew can teach many more classes because he's busy with many things, although that would be awesome.  However, I think that Younes did a great job of teaching.  If I understood what was said and am able to do the quizzes and homework, then I'm good. Eventually, we're gonna have to work and think independently, anyways.  I think the NLP courses tended to wean us towards that kind of work habit.  Thanks Younes, Lukas, and the rest of the team for these awesome and wonderful classes! On to courses 3 and 4!      ",5
2932,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,Jonathan D,"May 1, 2022","Really good course. Covers many topics thoroguhly and succinctly. Very detailed implementations. 
As feedback, I'd say it's often more difficult to follow and hit the nail in terms of the ""rigidity"" of the implementations than the concepts or notions being taught. It can feel like a course on how well do I understand the way this was designed and implmented than the ideas about natural language processing that underpin them. In the same breadth I'd say that these implementation methods are of course now in my toolbox and they have shaped my way of thinking.",5
2933,Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models by DeepLearning.AI,Leena P,"Oct 6, 2020","I enjoyed Younes's teaching style and the specializations course structure of asking the quizzes in between the lectures.

3018,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Nick A,"May 9, 2019","This course significantly lacks depth. The topic is covered at a very high-level and represents only a lightweight introduction.  You will not gain any insights into the challenges that someone might face using CNNs on Tensorflow in a real-world scenario.
This course does not compare to the kind of insights that you learn from the other courses taught by Andrew Ng.
There are no graded programming assignments to validate what you have learned.  The exercises that are provided are very simplistic. ",1

3021,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Asad K,"Jul 5, 2019","This is the second course of the specialization and still I feel like I haven't been introduced to anything beyond the free tutorials available on tensorflow website. So far the specialization has also been only focused on the keras api of tensorflow which makes me feel that perhaps the name of this specialization has been poorly chosen (perhaps it should be 'Keras in Practice Specialization'). On the positive side, the instructor is eloquent and the learning material is presented in a well and orderly fashion (ignoring some minor cases of redundancy in notebooks; basically copy pasting the whole notebook several times just to introduce a few lines of new code).   ",3
3022,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Jbene M,"Jul 31, 2019",This is pretty simple. This doesn't give an idea of the real use of keras. also there is no programming assignments.,2
3023,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Dan G,"Apr 22, 2020","This course is extremely disappointing. The content is very shallow, you'll get more from just following the keras tutorials in the official tensorflow docs. Also, since this specialisation only seems to cover the keras api, perhaps the title is a bit misleading.
On the plus side - it is pretty easy to complete the whole thing in a day and very easy to knock it out before the free trial ends. But honestly, even for free, I don't think it is worthwhile.
The material is very presented in small repetitive chunks, where you'l basically just be running the same notebooks over and over with one small new function thrown each each ""week"". The quizzes and assignments are riddled with typos which I think is a poor show for a paid for course.
The assignments are basically just copies of the coursework notebooks. No thinking required. 
I really would not recommend this specialisation. Your time will be better spent elsewhere. It is such a pity as the previous courses by Andrew Ng have been of such high quality. ",1
3024,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Walter H L P,"Aug 7, 2019","This course is so short in content that, in the whole last week, it is explained a trivial concept about multi-class classification.

The videos are usually 1-2 min long, really a headache to watch. The quiz is too simple and poorly designed-- instead of thinking or calculating you just need to remember some basic concepts/grammar rules. Programming exercises are not really useful and there is too much duplicate work. Not worth the money if you plan to pay for it-- auditing is enough.

In addition to that, I liked the idea behind dropout regularization, one of the strongest techniques to reduce interdependence between neurons and consequently minimize overfitting.  In the end, I got impressed by the shift from binary to multi-class classification and the fact that we no longer have to limit our results to two different output classes but to many more.

Thanks to Andrew and Laurence for putting this together, is a great source of information to understand more about DL. Some things I think could improve the course. 
I found the transfer learning lessons a bit unclear and I struggle generalizing this to other cases. Also, I was a bit confused by the flow of the course. The course starts with a multi classifier (or actually, the previous course), then the lessons focus on binary classifiers and it ends again with multi classifiers, because these should be the more complex ones.
One last technical thing, only on the last lesson of this course it is mentioned that the classifiers output the probabilities on alphabetical order when using ImageDataGenerators (or at least, that's my impresision). I've wondered since the course introduced the ImageDataGenerators, how the probabilities are assigned on the outputs. I could figure out on the sigmoid that the classifier would look for the first class on the directory and output 1 or 0 based on that, but it would be good to have this mentioned at some point on the video when the ImageDataGen is introduced.
Thanks again! Great course",4

3062,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Henrique G,"Jan 2, 2020","I'm sad to say that I'm really disappointed with the course. What is even stranger is that professor Andrew is associated and endorse the course. I like professor Marooney, but honestly, even his free tutorials on the Tensorflow channel on Youtube have more information than this course. It really seems like something put together in a haste just to make it available on Coursera. The level of detail and instructions is not on par with the quality of both the Coursera platform and the professors associated with this course.
It seems that as I progress through the courses in this specialization the instructions get poorer and poorer and the level of information gets more and more scarce. It got to a point where we are just given notebooks to run; they are not even graded (they barely were on the first course). And even the notebooks where the we are given a chance to complete some code, there are absurd things like ""print(#your code here#)"" in places that don't even make sense except if we copy and paste from the other notebooks of the course. Really? Print what? The only way we can guess what kind of debug info the notebook is asking is by looking at other notebooks at that exact same line.
For the reviewers; if you are really reading this, please remember that Coursera is charging $49/month for this specialization. If we consider that an average student will take 4 weeks to complete, that's almost $200 for something that's barely a tutorial at it's current version. $49 may be a reasonable rate for a citizen of the US, for example, but it's and exorbitant amount of money for students of poorer countries using the platform in hopes of acquire knowledge of decent quality.",3
3063,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Zoltan S,"Aug 3, 2020","After taking  Andrew Ng,s  truly excellent  5 course specialization, I was hoping that this  followup specialization would be at the same high level. In my view (and I am sad to say this) the present course doesn't live up to that expectation.
Of course you could still learn something useful, mostly a selected part of the Keras API. The instuctor is friendly and explains some of the basics of convolutional neural networks. If you are willing to experiment on your own (run the code longer on Colab, play with the hyperparameters, etc) then you get more practice and certainly more out of this experience. Keras has a lot of good tools. For more advanced students going directly to the TensorFlow tutorial website is also an option (and it is free).
Overall the course seems a bit rushed, while it has the potential to be better.  Let me suggest adding more basic materials to solidify knowledge (for example practicing hands-on image preprocessing before  teaching the Keras preprocessing API and overall  more experimentation with images). Also adding  more exercises on more diverse topics (GAN's, face detection, variational autoencoders, object detection). 
There are also some minor issues (easy to fix): for example right now in the Week 3 HW the prepared callback teaches the students  exactly the wrong approach. It stops the learning cycle when the training accuracy improves over a certain threshold,  instead of checking the validation accuracy. That is an unfortunate mistake to make in a week that  discusses different ways to avoid overfitting.",3
3064,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Kaustubh D,"Aug 6, 2019","This course is taught excellently, but there is very little content at least from a programming point of view. There was no need of an extra week for only specifying the differences of binary and multi-class classification in code. Rather, there could have been more covered if codes of different output structure like object recognition where the output is not a flat map could be covered. If it has been purposely done to keep the course open to even newbies in Machine Learning, then there should have been a course focussed for those who have done Andrew Ng's ML/DL specialization. ",3

However...
It feels a bit like an very well done tutorial. After finishing my second class I don't any any more idea of how to build a neural network than I did before. The data that they give you has already been cleaned and is ready to use which never happens in real life. The data manipulations that they ask you to do in the homework has zero explanation of why you are doing it. Just that add an extra dimension or split the data this way. I don't know why we need it split that way and it never says why. Further, exercise 4 in particular uses a different method than has been used for the entirety of first and second class. You're given a list of numbers rather than real images. 
At the end of the class I wanted to understand how to build these models in the real world. If I want to predict cats vs dogs then great! However, if I want to try to categorize financial transactions or predict fraud or literally anything else, this class gives you no understanding of where to start, or how to approach the problem generally.",2
3069,Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow by DeepLearning.AI,Pawel B,"May 2, 2020","The course does not provide much knowledge. In fact this is a tiny extension compared to first part (""Introduction to TensorFlow for...""). The assignments are trivial - you need to change one or two parameters from the excercise codes. But another story is that the codes you succesfully run in Jupyter need to be tailored to satisfy coursera system (e.g. data cannot be loaded due to out of memory, TF version is different etc.). Instead of working on the model, you loose time on experimenting with the code unrelated to tensorflow or look at the forum for solutions specically suited to pass the test (they do not change how the models works). Do not recommend this course.",2

It’s especially disappointing after taking the fantastic specialization by Andrew Ng, and makes this specialization feel like a cheap cash grab by Coursera and DeepLearning.ai. This series of courses fails to prepare you for three reasons:
1 – The certification exam is done on whatever is the current version of Tensorflow (v2.6 as of writing). You can’t expect a specialization like this to update every minor release, but much of the coding is still on the v1.X version!
2 – The certification exam requires you to work in the PyCharm IDE. The IDE doesn’t even get a mention in this specialization and it is all done through Google Colab.
3 – The material is covered at a very superficial level. I was hoping to walk out of it feeling confident in using Tensorflow on novel problems, but I’ve barely learned anything about Tensorflow that I didn’t already get from Andrew Ng’s specialization. There’re a few minutes of lectures (some weeks less than 10 minutes). The programming assignments are either pathetically easy, or lack any guidance on what to do (seriously sometimes there’s no instructions at all, you have to guess what to do by the variable names), or both.

The instructor is more interested to show off his synthesized dataset rather than teaching anything real. There was so much to teach like how to implement inception module, batch normalization, regularization (though dropout was introduced), and many more. Instead half of the course he was busy showing images from his datasets. Coding assignments were buggy too, the environment often crushes.

Through the courses, I gained a solid understanding of convolutional layers, pooling operations, and how they are used in tasks such as image classification and object detection.
One aspect that impressed me was the hands-on approach taken throughout the courses. The practical exercises and coding examples provided invaluable opportunities to implement CNN models in TensorFlow. By working through these exercises, I not only solidified my understanding of the theory but also gained confidence in implementing CNNs and experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.

Majority of the programming assignment should be relatively simple copy and paste if you know what you are doing.
For the last part you cant copy paste everything directly, neither was the code issue covered in the lecture sample code.

3195,AI for Medical Diagnosis by DeepLearning.AI,Surya P S,"Apr 21, 2020","IMO this is the weakest course offered by deeplearning.ai. It feels something more our of a medium blog than a full course that someone should pay money for. The good news is that you can sign up for a 7 day free trial and finish it before 7 days are over, so you're not out of any money, just your time. What do you learn? Some new metrics that are specific to medicine (specificity, sensitivity) and the concept of class imbalance (prevalence). The code assignments are designed by someone who understands the concepts well but is unable to teach some of them well (I'm being super critical here, coming from the viewpoint of someone who might spend $49 for a month on this).  At the end, I'm unsure what you can say you learned and if you can really demonstrate any concepts in a job interview at a healthcare (adjacent) job. There was some demonstration of segmentation, but a lot of it is really left up to the learner to experiment and learn from. You could talk about these things in a job interview, but a technical round would quickly discover that your knowledge is surface and not really in depth. My 2 cents (stars?). I apologize for being critical, but I've put 3 days into this course and not learned anything I couldn't have from a medium / towards data science blog. I do have higher expectations from courses coming from deeplearning.ai",2

Sincerely, explaining U-NET and segmentation in less than 20 minutes is quite ridicolous, in general it feels a really rushed course, nice if you can finish it for free, but not for long term learning. 
It is marketed as a real data course, but actually noone of the problems of real data are actually presented, just quickly talked about in the videos. It feels really substandard compared to the others deeplearning.ai courses",2

It's more like a one day seminar in a big university, it gives you a vague idea about the GANs, zero or practically non existent programming experience on GANs (since you basically fill some lines in a prewritten codes).

I have the impression that I did not manage to learn as much as I could, as most of the topics were covered very briefly and without giving enough details. The notebooks were also quite unsatisfactory. Having no prior experience with PyTorch, I was struggling at points, e.g. because I did not know how certain function behaved or how PyTorch is structured. Most of the exercises were either too simplistic or too cryptic for me. While I fully believe it is necessary for us to go over some stuff on our own, I feel that the type of exercises proposed during the course were mostly a coding challenge (e.g. find how to calculate the norm in PyTorch), rather than an explanation and a hand-on tutorial on how to build a GAN from scratches - 90% of the code was already there.",3

The obvious philosophy of DeepLearning.ai is to make Machine Learning easy and accessible for anyone. This is an honorable goal, however it is also dangerous, because at the end of the course you might believe you have mastered GANs when in truth you did not understand much at all. For intance, in the last week I was a little tired, so instead of trying to understand each line of code, I just did the exercise, and I solved it at the first try without really understanding the code. 95% of the code is already there, you have to code less than 5% by yourself. There is not even a final exam with a longer and harder task.
The problem with these easy courses is the fact that the certificates have zero value. If it was just about the certificates, I could do the entire course in one day. No company will take coursera certificates serious because of such easy courses. At least they course creators should be more honest and declare this as a one week course.",4

Later in the course, I set the speed as 0.75x and it was better. I feel like Andrew spoke little slow in Deep Learning courses and now I feel slower is better than fast.

Firstly, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude for the opportunity to learn about GANs in such a comprehensive and engaging manner. The course content was well-structured, making complex concepts easy to understand. The hands-on approach with practical exercises and real-world examples greatly enhanced my learning experience.

The knowledge and skills I gained from this course have been invaluable for my ongoing project on cancer detection using GANs. The course modules provided a deep understanding of GANs' potential in healthcare applications, and the practical assignments allowed me to apply this knowledge directly to my project.

Despite facing personal challenges during the course, the engaging content and supportive community made it possible to stay motivated and continue learning. As they say, ""A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor."" These challenges only made the learning experience more rewarding.

Now, here's a little AI-related humor to lighten the mood: Why don't machines ever laugh at jokes? Because they take things too literally!

In conclusion, this course has played a pivotal role in my academic journey, and I am grateful for the knowledge and skills it has imparted. I am excited about the potential of GANs in advancing healthcare technology and look forward to applying my learnings in my future endeavors.

Once again, thank you for a fantastic learning experience.

3366,Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Aladdin P,"Nov 21, 2020","I've just completed the specialization and my thoughts are that everyone should take it (that are interested in GANs! I feel Sharon is a great teacher and the entire team did a really good job on putting togethor these courses. After completing it I definitely have a much better view of GANs, their architectures, successes and limitations, and have a solid background to tackle reading papers and implementing them on my own. Thank you for making this specialization!
With all the positives (which is why I rate it 5/5) there are in my opinion things that can be improved. Especially I think there is too much hand holding for the labs, out of 100 rows of codes I code maybe 2-3%. Many of these don't give much value coding but I want to feel like I did it! Unfortunately now I am left guessing if I have truly mastered the material (and I'm quite sure I haven't, so I will need to re-implement these on my own). Also since you state that calculus and linear algebra are prerequisites then stick with it! You are trying to be too inclusive and there are several part of the courses where I thought it was entirely unecessary because everyone taken Calc and Linalg already has this knowledge. I would prefer instead if you spend this time making other videos where you go in more depth, perhaps going through some of the difficult math etc. Hopefully you try to improve this for future courses done by deeplearning.ai",5
3367,Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Vivek V,"Oct 26, 2020","The course is an introduction to GANs. You won't build anything particularly powerful but it provides a springboard to the future courses in the series. This course is light on video and instruction and relies more on exercises. This is fine and possibly better since presumably you already understand neural networks well and are just looking to understand how to build GANs. If you do not have a good foundation in deep learning, you should check out Andrew Ng's courses on deep learning first.
The exercises can be easier than they should, if you will. Sometimes, the setup of the code that they give you ""for free"" includes critical insights. Make sure to carefully read over and understand the code outside of the few lines that you need to code for each assignment.
Also, if you are interested, I encourage you to read some of the works cited, each of which made important contributions. Focus on those that are most relevant to your work. Personally, I found ""Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs for Semantic Face Editing"" the most compelling.",5
3368,Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,B S C,"Jan 3, 2021","Good class, it actually touches on mathematical aspects, and the text comprises contemporary work in the field.   The programming assignments are well-designed so that, while there are usually only 10-20 lines of code to fill in (at most),  one must actually think carefully about what the algorithms are doing, read the pytorch manual, and try some test scripts to make sure tensors are being handled correctly.  
This is my first experience with PyTorch, and so far I like working with it better in this context than I have working with TF in other classes and books - pytorch seems to be more of a straightforward extension to the numpy / pandas / sklearn paradigm.  The focus is on ""what the algorithm does"" rather than on ""the mechanics of the framework"" - although part of that may be due to instructional styles as well.",5

As an incoming softmore in University, I could say this course is likely the best resource to start learning GANS I've come accross, and I've scoured the internet.
For students that completed Andrew Ng's deep learning course or had a similar course in University, this course only builds on it and most difficult concepts are easy to grasp with the background.

3445,Data Modeling in Power BI by Microsoft,aristo,"Nov 13, 2023","Beware! Since not many people give detailed reviews, I will be that one.

Today I finished this course. Here are some important things you should know before enrolling:

Pros:
1. Covered most of the crucial aspects of data modeling.
2. Contents are consistent.

Cons:
1. I found a lot of information redundant. Such as: 'Imagine you are a data analyst...' OR 'This could help AdventureWork to gain better insights on...' I mean, you say that once or twice it's okay, but you don't need to repeat information like that for each lecture. You need to work on your information granularity. Plus, tons of obvious typos and misleading phrases exist in the reading materials.

2. Lack of exercise examples. AND WAIT A SECOND, The TWO MOST important assignments were missing critical Excel files for download! And one of them happened to be the final project! Guess what, customer service won't help you nor refund you, they ask you to post this issue and wait for 10 days for a response. Excuse me, why are you wasting my time to compensate for your own mistakes? Hell, I know if you would ever respond to me since I realized ppl were reflecting on this issue months ago, and no one cares!

3. 50% of the quizzes were okay, as they were asking the crucial aspects regarding the important concepts, but some questions were just playing word teasers. I mean this is a section where students are supposed to understand how to use DAX to create measures and stuff, but the total number of questions about the DAX is very limited.

Compared with the previous modules, this one is a big disappointment and failure.

If after reading this you still want to enroll, my suggestion is to enable yourself to do more research and not solely rely on the materials provided within this module. Additionally, skip the unnecessary wordy content to save your time and money!",1

3498,Data Modeling in Power BI by Microsoft,Irene B,"Nov 3, 2023","This is a good foundational course on the way of mastering Power Bi. However, there are some areas that could be improved on:
- DAX learning material structure was confusing - first there was a very high level overview of DAX functions, then a quite involved assignment, then a step-by-step walkthrough and then a guided project where the concepts used in the assignment were explained on simple examples. It would be much easier to understand the concepts if the guided project was first, than an example similar to the assignment, and then the assignment with some variations would go last. 
- The quality of materials in this course was not high - there were wrong datasets in 2 assignments; some datasets were saved with local paths so Transform Data threw an error and didn't open; there was an outdated quiz question about Power Bi UI where correct answer does not correspond to the current UI. All this made exercise experience less enjoyable.  
Overall, this course was harder than the previous 3. DAX concepts were hard and practice was limited. I'm going to take a pause between this and the next course to spend some more time practicing DAX and measures.",4

This course verbally discussed a topic,  then jumped right to testing us on it as if we've already done it, then after that, showed us how to do it.   That's backwards.  Just watching somebody talk about something doesn't mean we know what we're doing.   2. On your exams, you make T/F questions the same weight as the tricky multiple answer (check box) questions.  They're all 1 point.  Now you know the T/F questions are way easier than the harder questions so why not make the ones that have 3 right answers worth 3 points.   I think it sucks that I'm solid on say 2 of the 3, no question, but unsure of the 3rd.  It's obviously a guess and you're going to give 0 when I was sure of 2/3 of it, and usually the one I'm not sure of is some weirdly worded tricky thing, maybe only mentioned once.  It's something hard to remember, almost unnecessary or irrelevant, but you're give a zero for that.   That's lame.  Make every question meaningful.  Don't screw people on these weirdo screwball questions that you know most people don't know.  The ones who get it right are just guessing and luckier, not smarter or better.  ",3

That being said, the content also lacks sufficient guidance, particularly when referring to particular calculations - you are merely tasked with making it, not scaffolded into using a particular calculation/function. Adding to this is the use of functions within calculations - not only are you learning a new function, you are learning how an alternative new function fits within the new function. It adds an unneccessary hurdle to practicing the content.

Regarding the practice, I feel like this module could really benefit from more regular practice that involves a breakdown explanation of what a function is actually doing, and then build that back up into where it can slot itself into various calculations.

Beyond this, there seems to be a ""session"" date associated with the course, rather than end dates - this has resulted in being locked out of completing the course within a suited timeframe.",2

3529,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Georg K,"Sep 8, 2018","This course is not suited for beginners and people looking for an introductory lecture to Linear Algebra! Unfortunately the topics are extremely hastily presented and lack depth of explanation, sufficient examples and often leave out content required to complete the assignments. The material is not presented in a coherent way, and, for someone new to Linear Algebra like me, requires a great amount of self-study outside the course (e.g. Khan Academy) to comprehend the content. The team of lecturers is very likeable and enthusiastic. However, I do not comprehend where this course seeks to position itself: it is not suited for students new to Linear Algebra, and, not extensive enough for someone seeking to learn underlying mathematics for Machine Learning as this course simply doesn't cover Machine Learning. Finishing this course, I have some vague understanding of certain concepts and I am left longing for proper and structured content that I could feel confident about.",1
3530,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,ATUL A,"Mar 13, 2019",I can't follow what is happening. There is a huge gap between what is being taught and what is being asked in the assignments.,1
3531,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Andrew M,"Mar 16, 2019","Disclaimer: If you are familiar with Linear Algebra, you may love this course. This review is not for those people. This review is for the people who went to the course details, saw that the recommended audience was 'Beginner' level, and decided to give it a try, thinking it involved a low barrier of entry. You'd be thinking incorrectly. Here is why.  
Let me start off by stating two things. First: I am terrible at all things mathematics, and wanted to improve my capabilities in this area. Second: This is by far the worst Coursera course that I've taken to date. I put all my effort into not only completing the course, but doing so on time, so that I don't dump more money into a course than completely necessary. With this course, I found myself loathing the prospect of torturing myself with the material, that I kept putting it off. I eventually had to come to terms that I hated this whole experience, and canceled my subscription prior to completing even the first course!
1.) The videos are absolutely useless - Up-to-date on all the latest and great math jargon? Well, you'd better be, or else you'll find yourself Googling terms like a madman and re-watching the videos over and over, just to get a grasp on what is going on. All this is topped off with the instructor talking a mile a minute (does he even breathe?) and making numerous mistakes throughout the videos. This will then prompt you to pause the video you were watching to go search the forums in order to see if the way you were taught to do something in a previous video was incorrect all along, just to find a post that confirms that the video did in fact have an error. Do yourself a favor and skip directly to the practice quizzes. You'll be equally clueless as to what is going on, but you won't have wasted time by watching pointless videos.
2.) I'm assuming the assignments and practices quizzes are in some way correlated to the subject matter depicted in said useless videos in point 1. If there is, then the questions therein are massively beefed up version of the subject. Nothing made me feel quite as stupid as practice quiz 1 of week 4 (this is where I finally gave up and called it quits). The only redeeming factor is that I'm not the only doofus in the room. The student forums are full of equally clueless people.
3.) For the price of $50 a month, I expected this course to house all I would need to ease me into the topic of Linear Algebra. Instead, it feels like I've been thrown into the ocean with cinder blocks strapped to my feet without knowing how to swim. Logically, I started grasping for the life boats that are Khan Academy and YouTube. I shouldn't have to go to external resources if I'm paying money to be taught something, but I did. Even though these external resources helped me better understand the concepts, the quiz material still looked like absolutely gibberish to me. That's when I knew this was no ""Beginner"" course.
All said, just buy a Linear Algebra text book off of Amazon if you want to learn this topic. It's cheaper in the long run, and coupled with Khan Academy, it'll get you farther. The only reason it isn't a single star for me is the fact that maybe it is beneficial for people who actually like math.",2
3532,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Pirkka P,"Apr 23, 2019","Too many sessions and quizzes which appear to require previous knowledge of the taught subject, concept and the details. If I had that knowledge already, I would not be taking the course to begin with. The programming assignment do require previous Python/other programming experience. I would not categorize this as a 'beginner' class. ",1
3533,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Juan D,"Mar 21, 2019"," The teacher's explanation videos are excellent, really really clear: it makes you feel as though they really paid attention on how to deliver the content in the most understandable way possible. The teacher speaks clearly, the audio and the subtitles are on point, etc. 
 Unfortunately, this all goes in flames when compared to the mess that is the evaluation system, which seems to jump two or three orders of magnitude in difficulty compared to what is actually taught in the lessons. This, in turn, makes it impossible to know whether the failure to get correct answers is due to one's own lack of competence, the bad quality of the lessons, or the lack of competence on the part of those tasked with creating the quizzes. 
 Based on my experience, as well as on the comments by other people equally baffled by the quizzes -not to mention the almost absolute absence of mentors willing to help out-, I strongly suspect it is the latter. 
 In my opinion, the course's effectiveness could dramatically increased if it included a lot more exercises at different levels of difficulty, in order for the students to really absorb each unit's contents. This would also have the advantage of preparing them for the really difficult questions on the ""big quizzes"".",2

Having read some other opinions here I find it a little bit odd to read people complaining about the python tasks. If you come to a course like this one is because you are interested in ML so python is something you will surely be using, so learning a bit before engaging this course would be a first step.

The first course in the specialization was a train wreck.  For starters, the videos were heavy on theory and light on examples, so when it came time to do the practice exams, each student needed to go to outside sources to learn, from the top, what they needed to do to complete the questions.  This expectation is unacceptable.  Secondly, no mention in the course information, videos, etc. was there any indication that there was coding.  These coding assignments are delivered with no hint given as to what we would need to do, how, and why, which is entirely unacceptable.  Lastly, the course creators are available nowhere.  There are hundreds of questions on the forums for each week of each course, with not one answer coming from any of the course creators.  I even went out of my way to find the email for the leading course creator and ask for additional resources/help but received zero response in return.  I have been an avid supporter of Coursera for a long while now, but this specialization is terrible enough that I would consider never utilizing this site again.  Mathematics for Machine Learning is an embarrassment to the entire service and devalues all of the work individuals have put into learning through this platform.  It does this by diminishing the quality of the certificate by demeaning the level of competence acquired upon completion.  If I were in charge of content, I would remove this specialization as well as thoroughly review all content published by the same institution.

I liked specially the effort to make the students get the necessary intuition instead of pushing a lot examples as many other MOOC usually do. But I've noticed some negative points. I ask you to take my critic as a sincere effort to improve the course and eliminate some mistakes that really matters to the students. The last quiz seems quite disconnected with the lectures and there isn't a support guide or tutorial not even a mentor answering the questions in the week 5 forum. Some mistakes on videos (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were confirmed by the lecturer but never corrected. Not even a errata on resources section.

Other than the first 2-3 intuition videos  and the programming assignment nothing was good in the 5th module/week.

At one stage David Dye offhandedly mentions soh-cah-toa... and that really sums up a lot of what is required in terms of mathematical maturity - high school maths at a reasonable level.
Those that undertake the course should be assisted by referring to additional materials when they feel things are a bit of a struggle, I did, and this greatly helped, although my Maths was around UK high school level (in Algebra and Trig).

It helped me to see other subitems such as Gramm Schmitt and eigenvectors that I did not see on college, I understood them but not a 100%, I guess an 75% is an average.

3559,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Mary B,"Jan 29, 2021","I only completed three out of the five weeks of this course.  Too many of the lessons were just a source of frustration for me.  The instructor doesn't explain things very well. For example, with change in vector basis, he walked us through using the dot product and scalar values, but then added them up.  Nowhere did he say the last part was just a check, and it had me confused for quite a long time.  Then, with Einstein's Summation Convention, he doesn't really explain the subscripts and what rules there are for their use.  Plus, it's hard to follow along because he says the math out loud, then just writes down the answer.  Since this is new to me, it would be good to see it written out, like | (1/2)(-2)  + (-1)(4) |.  Far too often, I had to rely on other resources to get enough of an understanding to complete the quizzes.  By the fourth week, I started just skipping to the quiz and finding other resources to teach me how to solve the problems.  Then, I decided to just give up entirely.  And finally, there were issues with the auto-grader.  With one, I needed to write out the values as 2.0 instead of 2, but there was no mention of needing this precision.  With another, it was A[3, 0] (with a space) instead of A[3,0] (without a space), even though the provided code used A[1,0] (without a space). ",1

The instructors were simply amazing. Totally loved every bit of the course. Amazing way to teach this math course, with proper motivation and intuition. 
And for all the people writing negative reviews about no Machine Learning being taught in this course, it is clearly mentioned that this course teaches the math which is required for learning Machine Learning and not Machine Learning itself.",5

3564,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Nabil C,"Oct 5, 2020","First of all, the instructor clearly loves the subject he is teaching. You can tell immediately by the voice and the gestures.
Second,
 the fact that he is not a pure mathematician means he is constantly 
looking for the link between what he is teaching and practical examples.
 That's a must when you are teaching math to students intending to use 
it in real life (Machine Learning).
Third, there is a good structure to the material being taught, always building on what has previously been taught.
Fourth,
 is the amount of quizzes and exercises. Math can only be learned 
effectively if you keep challenging yourself in quantity and quality. 
Everyone remembers the quality bit, but some miss the quantity. Not this
 instructor I have to say. Congrats for that.
Fifth, intuition 
is being built from day one. Big applause for that as Linear Algebra 
lives and dies by the amount of intuition that's being put into its 
practice.
Sixth, my hat's off for the esthetic quality of the figures and exercises, and for their clarity.
Seventh,
 even for an engineer like me (graduated over 20 years ago I have to 
say) who's been best friends with Linear Algebra and Calculus for the 6 
years I was in university (10 semesters + a final Master's thesis), this
 course wasn't trivial, and kept me making an effort at every bend, at 
every corner. This is something I am grateful for, as while I was 
refreshing concepts that I hadn't touched for 20 years now, I did have 
real fun.
Eighth, the coding examples are a magnificent tool 
that greatly helped strengthening some concepts (like Gram-Schmidth, 
etc.). Amazing job there.
Ninth, you can see how towards the end of the course, gears are shifted, pushing the student to get mental agility, and conveying the student the importance of intuition building (+ some algebraic symbolic manipulation) as opposite of focusing mainly on the symbolic manipulation. A good approach nowadays that computers do the computation for us, as opposite to what it used to be some decades ago. I really liked the fact that the instructors (Dr. Dye and Dr. Cooper) tried, both, to covey this very practical philosophical paradigm from day one.
My most sincere ""cum laude"" score for this course.

Amazing explanations of the covered topics, extremely engaging teaching staff

Overall a tremendous course if you want to brush up on linear algebra. To me LA was taught mostly doing rote calculations without motivating the concepts or explaining them geometrically.

3571,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Petey C,"Aug 22, 2021","This course is seriously lacking. I spent almost all of my time on Khan Academy due to the horribly high-level video lectures. The lectures in this course threw out strategies and ideas without explanation of the foundational mathematics behind them. Then the students are expected to apply these unexplained strategies to complex problems in the quizzes. 
On the other hand, the programming assignments were a joke. They provided zero learning experience as everything needed to solve the assignments was provided in the already completed sections of code. Minimal thought was involved.

This course needs a serious overhaul. These are complex topics that require more than a 4-10 minute video to explain. I understand that this is not an actual college course, and as such the professors cannot go as in depth comparatively. However, in its current state, this course has given me little understanding of linear algebra.

From the reviews seem like people were not satisfied with the lectures, but since week 1 they recommended plenty of Linear Algebra textbooks and Youtube. I like it because it encourages self-learning than being spoon-fed by the lectures.

Not going to lie, this was the most challenging coursera course I have taken so far but that means I actually spent hours studying!

My tips would be to watch the Youtube videos they recommend early in the course and attempt all the ungraded exercises. Utilize the discussion forum if you are stuck. I find the discussion forum and Youtube playlist really helped me grasp the concept. If you can get the textbooks, it's not necessary but they are also great study supplements",5

If you do, at least take a famous reference book like Strang and follow the course with the book. Also, do not expect to watch the videos and understand the content magically. The course is full of assignments and challenging exercises, which are fundamental to having fun with the MOOC.

This course helped me to review knowledge and, more than that, to develop new intuition about some topics in Linear Algebra. The instructors are great! The video production is really good!

Programming assignments: They are NOT for beginners too, assignments are not that something you can understand right away without basic coding knowledge (loop, else if, function, variable). If you don't know any of these, consider learning elsewhere before study this.

Some caveats
a) this course is not for the absolute beginner. You'll need secondary / high school math, and basic familiarity with python
b) understanding linear algebra at this level is a second year full semester course at university. So if you want to understand the concepts - rather than just get the certificate - be prepared to use outside resources and invest considerably more time than advertised. Some linear algebra topics are skipped (cross product), and others are not well integrated into the course (Einstein summation)
c) while linear algebra is central to understanding machine learning, there are very few machine learning applications in this course.
And finally a small annoyance: I wish the instructors would get out of the way of the whiteboard at the end, so I could get a screen capture.

Most of the math explained is fairly easy to understand. They cover the fundamentals of linear algebra, and provide plenty of assignments and practice exercises to test your knowledge. However, some of the video explanations are extremely confusing and feel rushed. For example, some videos in Week 4 and 5 like Reflecting in a plane using Gram-Schmidt and the PageRank algorithm were so hard to understand that I had to learn about them from elsewhere on the internet (I used MIT OCW a lot). This isn't very convenient, especially if you're paying for the course. Furthermore, I felt like more videos explaining the applications of linear algebra in machine learning could've been made, and the ones that were already made could've been made in more detail (for example, the term 'span' was never formally explained). Lastly, I would've loved it if there was another week dedicated solely to introduce the coding bit, because it's really difficult and takes a while if you have little or no prior experience in python.

3.) There is no support in discussion forums from the lecturers of this course. I have seen many questions remain unanswered for many months. This is a very big drawback.
4.) There is a huge gap between what is being taught in videos and what is being asked in assignments. We can understand this by the following corollary: In the video tutorial one teacher is showing that 1 + 2 = 3. In the assignment, students are being asked to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
5.) Some questions and even their answers too technical to be understood by many students. The attempt to explain after the completion of assignment is also too technical. There should be an attempt to dive deeper to help weaker students. If time is the constraint, then make another basic course and let that be a prerequisite of this course. But please, do not mention in the introduction of this course that there is no prerequisite.",2
3613,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,eklektek,"Jul 25, 2020","The course seemed rather lazy using classical presentation methods not going the extra mile and benefitting from more model methods of visualisation and interaction. Instead the student has to hear a lot of words and try decipher the language and sketches of the speaker.  I'm a native english speaker and I had problems. Complex subjects need a language that everybody can understand - visualisation.
There was finally some interactive visuals, in the fifth and final week, but these seemed more of an after thought. Also they were not integrated into the course. They would have yielded greater benefit if the lecturer used them too and pointed out specific points. Instead this information came from a few lines of explanatory text.
Generally the course material seemed like the minimum they could get away with, almost as if coursera charges hosting space.
In conclusion, the course has been beneficial, but it could have been so much more beneficial. So next I will look for a course more tightly coupled to my learning style and requirements. If this search fails I may return.",2

From my perspective, I just watched someone who knows math and is flaunting his knowledge instead of actually showing how to approach a question. The questions provided in the quiz are there without a proper explanation or an example on how to solve them.

2. Whenever a theory/solution is explained, the lecturer doesn't pause or emphasis that this is a point. Instead, he goes on as quickly as humanly possible. Additionally, the drawings/board writing illustrations end up like a bowel of spaghetti after he is over, good luck figuring out what happened there!

1) In the quiz on 'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors' in the Week-5 module -- I personally faced a lot of problems in completing the quiz. I understand the concepts pretty well from the lectures but still, I could not figure out the questions in this particular quiz. Particularly the questions about finding the effect of using a particular Link matrix on the eigenvectors. These questions were not easy to answer as intuitively speaking I did not learn how to interpret the meaning of different values in the eigenvectors matrix to answer those questions forex. it makes the eigenvalues small or It makes the eigenvalues we are looking for larger.
Overall - it is a really useful and much-required course to fill in the gap between the mathematical fundamentals and the practice of machine learning. I am glad that the Professors came up with this idea to design this course.",5
3633,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Stefano C,"Apr 23, 2021","Thanks for this wonderful learning opportunity! This is the first math course that I've succesfully completed and I'm quite proud of myself. Teaching material is very clear and nicely structured - I've shared the first video about Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues with many people: it's illuminating -; also, quizzes and programming assignments really helped in understanding some of the main concepts. Actually, the nice balance among theory, hand-made calculations, geometrical examples and programming assignments provides a valuable way to learn from multiple perspectives.
Apart from this. I realize that I still have to completely ""digest"" some of the concepts that have been introduced here. In other words, I've learned to use them decently but for sure I need to reharse some of them in order to fully understand their meaning. But, by the way, this is fair enough: linear algebra is a complex and deep subject and five weeks are probably not enough to fully understand its main principles.   ",5
3634,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Bram D,"Apr 29, 2020","In reviewing this course it is important to state what this course is and what it is not. It is not an in-depth formal introduction to the mathematics of linear algebra. For those who are looking for that, the course simply does not deliver. Secondly, while it is technically possible to complete this course without any beforehand knowledge of the topic, I think this would be incredibly challenging to do. Indeed, the course is not intended to be a first primer in linear algebra. The ease with which the instructors just juggle the cosine rule, or calculate the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix indicates that they do assume you know such things. So also absolute beginners will be disappointed with this course. However, if you have had linear algebra in your past, and you are using this course to refresh your mind, it is absolutely brilliant. I can confidently say that nobody has ever presented this material to me in as intuitive a way. A well deserved five stars from me.",5
3635,Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by Imperial College London,Juan R,"Mar 28, 2021","The course touches base in the main topics of Linear Algebra utilized in ML. I took this course at the same time with a ML one. I hadn't had linear algebra in University and the contents of this course helped me get through many bottlenecks in the ML course (which obviously takes for granted Algebra). 
The videos are very well produced, animations look great and explanations are crystal clear. 
The instructors present the topics in a friendly way and always keep the focus on the concepts rather than on manual calculations (of which you won't be doing much in ML...).
  The only downside is that watching videos more slowly (0.75x) is not fluent. I don't know if the issue is on my end or if the videos don't have enough frames per second.  
If you have no Linear Algebra basis and are planning to do ML, It's definetely worth it taking this course. ",5

The conscious avoidance of heavy mathematical description was a good choice for the online medium.  As a learner, I suppose I might have learned better with a bit more... testing, I suppose is the word? To work through a few more examples? But actually, a few well-chose gulfs between the presented materials and (especially the last) testing materials brought some useful questions and explanations.  The eigenvector materials are conceptually slippery.  Maybe one more example to work through, with clumsier numbers? Although, maybe that would have been boring and confusing...

They visualize entire concepts of linear algebra so that we can understand the topics very clearly. This is the way to teach linear algebra.

I have tried other LA courses and these books can absorb all your time and you may find yourself at the same place after 6 months.

This is a bit annoying, as the courses appear so far apart, I have paid over $40 for each of these three, for what could essentially be a weekend course (all three courses combined).

As has already been mentioned in other comments, the whole course can be compressed into no more than two hour long lecture and exercises over an afternoon.
The lectures consist of short videos introducing snippets of code and occasionally making claims but without actual notebooks with which people can play and reproduce results. 
The quizzes through out this specialization have been written extremely poorly, testing irrelevant (if any) information about datasets and naming modules etc. The quizzes are so trivial that the fact the course grade and certificates are only based off performance on the quizzes makes the whole idea of paying to get certificates questionable.
The exercise notebooks are okay but are extremely redundant. After the great expectations built from taking Andrew's deeplearning specialization and machine learning course, I must say the first three courses of this specialization have been extremely disappointing. 
I still want to thank the instructors and the team for taking the time and effort to build this specialization. Perhaps I'm just not the audience it was aimed at. 
My recommendation to other learners is to first checkout the free tutorials on tensorflow website and keras blog, and then audit through videos in this specialization before deciding to pay for it (Also make sure to first check a few other resources, e.g. Deep Learning with Python textbook by Francois Chollet, the github repo for which is public and the notebooks are almost exactly the same as here but more in-depth).

Not sure how it is fair for them to release a specialization that isn't complete and take people's money while they finish the last course... Other than that... So far, this has been a good series of courses in the Tensor Flow in Practice specialization.

The lecturer guides you through the process adding a little piece each lesson, showing you the results and giving you the chance to try them yourself on a lot of different notebooks.
While there are no graded assignments, you are still given the chance to build a model by yourself every week and put into practice everything you learned.
This is a really hands-on series of courses and as such you have to seek theory explanation somewhere else. Despite that, to help the students who didn't take the Deep Learning Specialization there are numerous resources linked in case you wanted to develop a better understanding of the subject.
I think that the best thing is that it's not a Tensorflow tutorial (you can find that online), but it helps the student develop a way of tackling NLP problems, explaining the building blocks necessary to create a model. ",5

All videos are indecently short (from 1 to 4 minutes in majority) and do not give any intuition or understanding of the sequence models. GRU's and LSTM's are explained too briefly. Weird decision to choose Trax framework, it offers no reasonable advantages over Keras in this course. Also, I do not think that implementing the data generator function in the programming assignments gives anyone better intuition in understanding the core material. The last two assignments can be completed even without watching the lecture videos.

I think it is a lost opportunity, the majority of the course is just familiarise with the trax API and blindly apply neural network architectures using the API.

1. I like that the Python tutorials and assignment helps me learn the state of the art DL framework Trax and be more familiar with the working mechanism under the hood. If you read through the python scripts carefully and look up the linked documentation, they are really nice study resources.
2. This course improves my understanding of some models that I learned in other specialization courses such as Siamese model (e.g. hard negatives) for natural language. 
3. Although the slides are made fancier than before, I'm not sure I enjoy the way it is explained. It's like reading the script and not really talking TO the students. Maybe some direct (live) notes on the slides helps students actually ""dive in"" ;) . 
4. I watched your live discussion on YouTube on 29. July and feel the lectures talks very naturally there, but in the teaching video they behave in a quite unnatural way. 
5. What I love about Andrew's DL specialization is that he also talks about his insights in a sincere (and personal) way, but in this course, it's just tooooo official.

3803,Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Vincent R,"Jan 13, 2022","Very superficial information about different types of neural networks and their uses. Use of Trax makes it nearly impossible to Google anything helpful - a lot of the assignments just tell you to read the documentation. To finish the assignments, you can basically copy-paste the code you're given to set up Trax neural networks and generators without having any idea what you're doing (because, again, the content doesn't go over it).
For example, Week 1 in this course introduces you to Trax (can't be run on Windows), covers aspects of object-oriented programming, and talks at a very high level about how to do things in Trax before moving onto a cursory discussion of generators. Then the assignment has you increment counters, set limits in FOR loops, copy negative-sentiment code from positive-sentiment code that's already completed, and fill in some code that's basically given right above where you write it. 
Overall, any code you write is usually very simple but often easy to get wrong because of the lack of direction, e.g. model(x,y) vs model((x,y)). The discussion boards are invaluable because the mistake might have been 3 functions earlier that the built-in tests didn't catch.

In the assignements, Trax is used only for toy problems, and then, we use a precomputed model. Even the fastnp is used in a very slow mode. Why to learn NLP in a obscure and really bad documented framework if we will finish to use a precomputed models?
Moreover, I try to replicate the results in my own machine (or even in colab) it does not work, because Trax change a lot between versions. Again, why to use, in a course, a framework that is not stable?

I enjoyed learning about data manipulation, sampling, and iteration or generation process and Trax.  At first I was a little hesitant about learning a new program or library like Trax but I found Lukas' talk to be helpful and convincing.  I feel Trax does simplify the coding process quite nicely.  The homework seemed repetitive but I found that approach to be very useful because I think the intent was to help us familiarize with the coding process and Trax more quickly.

Really Good examples: Week1 labs and assignment illustrate the implementations of some of the basic layer classes, and outline the overall flow of NN training with Trax. Week4 labs and assignment illustrate the implementation of the loss layer based on the unique triple loss function. 
Not so Good examples: Week1 uses a whole video explaining gradient calculation in Trax. Yet there is no illustration of how it's integrated in backward propagation in Trax.  Week2 videos and the labs/assignment are more disjoint. There is a video explaining the scan() function, but it does not show up in the assignment at all. ",3

Although many complained about the use of trax as a DL framework, I must say, I found fantastic to be able to learn it from people involved in the development! This per se is already an A+. I congratulate the team in taking this decision and pushing this forward. Trax is intuitive and *very* elegant. Chapeau for the devs! If it is as performant as they say for large data sets, this is the future and I am very pleased that the instructors decided to prepare us for it. Apart from all this positive side, I saw in this third course again some content at the end of the assignments that was not introduced during the corresponding week. For example, the Gumbel sampling at the end of Week 2. This was not a graded exercise, therefore it is not a major problem. Nevertheless, it comes out of the blue for the student and it is hard to connect the dots and understand why are we performing this operation at all for the text generation. So, there are a couple of loose threads here and there along the course. But it is a minimal problem. On the other hand, the presentation and discussion of the sequential models in all 4 weeks are very good, again an optimal balance between mathematical formalism, intuition and ease to code. Moreover, the choice of applications in the four week are just right, classification, generation, NER and one shot learning. All in all an awesome package, congratulations! ",5
3833,Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Sukhmanjeet S,"Feb 26, 2023","I recently completed the ""Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models"" course on Coursera and I must say, it was an incredible learning experience. The course content was very well-organized and easy to follow, with each topic building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive understanding of natural language processing and sequence modeling.
The course instructor, Younes Bensouda Mourri, is a true expert in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and his expertise and passion for the subject matter really shone through in the lectures. He presented the material in a clear and engaging way, and his enthusiasm for the topic was contagious.
The programming assignments were challenging, but not overwhelming, and I found that they really helped to solidify my understanding of the material. The course materials also included interactive quizzes and discussion forums where I was able to connect with other students and learn from their experiences.
Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in natural language processing and sequence modeling. The course content is top-notch, the instructor is excellent, and the assignments and quizzes provide a great way to reinforce your learning. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this course is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to learn about NLP and sequence modeling.",5
3834,Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models by DeepLearning.AI,Yashuv B,"Jan 19, 2023"," The course is expertly designed and provides a comprehensive understanding of the material through a combination of theoretical concepts and practical, hands-on experience. One of the key highlights of the course is the demonstration of the power of sequential models which can outperform probabilistic models that was taught previously and some additional assignments, giving students a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Overall, the course effectively balances theoretical and practical elements to provide a well-rounded and engaging learning experience.  ",5

I needed to check in on some of the discussions in the discussion forums for this one, so the discussion forums are especially useful (for assignments for weeks 3 and 4). As in the first 2 courses in this specialization, this one also adds most value in its 'lab' and assignment Jupyter notebooks. The videos serve as a gentle introduction to the topics and the concepts from the lectures are emphasized upon in the assignments/labs. Great introductory course overall!",5

I took Andrew Ng's courses and was impressed, but I am very disappointed by the quality of this course. Deeplearning.ai, please have some quality control over the courses you offer, otherwise it hurts your brand name!",1
3905,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Lucas F,"Sep 27, 2020","The course is rather disappointing.  Videos are short. They give you an intuition, why something works but don't go much into the details. When teacher said ""Now you are an expert in transformers"" it sounds like a mockery.  The course material is split into four weeks, however you can obtain certificate after spending a few days.
Homeworks won't teach you much. For you to understand, by now the most hard exercise according to course's Slack is to write a function with model and input tokens as input, which should predict next token. It's body contains only 8 lines of code, some of them is already given, your task is well explained.
Trax, a deep learning framework, that is used in homeworks might be a great framework, but not for learners. All you need to do, is just to pick a layer, put it in right place and 
voila. But instructions makes a situation even worse. It is so detailed, that you can just copy a code from instructions, paste it into your code and obtain a working solution. Sometimes you should look at documentation just to see the argument's name.  You won't have to think about dimensions, you won't have to think about structure of a model. When you decide to write a transformer from scratch with Pytorch then, you will struggle hard, but the price is much deeper understanding.
Would I recommend taking this course? I think, that course team did a nice work to provide you an overview of the state of the art techniques in NLP. Some references are amazing. So if you treat this course like intorductory, you could take it.  But don't expect too much.  When you are said, that  you will ""build a chatbot using a Reformer model"" take in mind that the crucial skill to do it, is just a copy-pasting.",2

Then I saw the existing reviews and was happy to see I'm not alone to feel like that: 
- Overly superficial coverage of theory in videos; too many things not explained well (if at all).  For example: last week's videos are about... 18 minutes. REALLY? I thought we were talking more complex stuff here. If one can be taught this in 18 minutes, then... oh well...
- Lots of ""copy-paste  this here"" parts in assignments, too (not much thinking/effort required). 
- The quizzes are (as in most courses) a joke, they're there just for the sake of it; I just skip them.
- Looks to have been created in too much of a rush; I don't know if that's the case, but that's the feeling I get from the content quality...
Based on the success of the original Andrew Ng courses, the quality bar is high as are the expectations. I hope there is better quality control in future specializations, either in-house or by better selection of external beta-testers. I can't believe several reviewers bring this up, but no one else did before the release.",2
3908,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Kabakov B,"Sep 26, 2020","the NLP spec course has ~30min video on every week, and sum-ups are ~1/4
 of it. Thus, one cannot expect a good and profound theory knowledge, 
only some intuition and insights.Without theory, it can be expected 
that program tasks should contain something practical and superficial. 
Like crash-course into the most popular packages in the field. But tasks
 are huge – x6 time more than a theory – and boring. A lot of spaghetti 
code with few levels of enclosed IF’s, with constructions like 
`A[i][j:k][l+1]`, low code reuse, global variables, and `from utils 
import *`.The student will spend time doing the bad implementation 
of 100K times implemented things, and that will not provide him with 
enlightenment on how they are implemented because of a lack of the 
theory.And nobody will teach him how to use standard tools on simple
 and understandable examples. It is boring, exhausting, and impractical.

The videos tend to oversimplify to the point of not explaining the concepts correctly or being flat out wrong and fail to give critical context to fully understand what is being explained. On the other hand, the homework was interesting (especially when compared to other courses out there) and did go in more depth, making students think through the details of some of the algorithms and models.        tldr; learn the content elsewhere, take the course for the homework + to learn about trax.",2

I think that overall this is a very a good introduction to the topic. Some concepts are really well explained - in a simple manner and with a lot of jupyter-lab code to experiment with.
In general in this specialization - the first 3 courses are good. There are some quirks (e.g. why Lukas is needed at all? He doesn't really teaches, just passes it on to Younes) but nevertheless I learned from it. And I think they have good value in them.
The 4th one, however, is completely disappointing. First 2 ""weeks"" are confusing, not really well explained, but somewhat ""bearable"". The last 2 weeks are a complete sham. They claim to teach ""BERT"" and ""T5"" but don't really give any value. You're better off going elsewhere to learn these concepts.

However, it has the depth of a puddle. While they provide links to existing papers, it would have been nice to hear them discussed in detail by the instructors.
Additionally, the choice to use trax really hinders the experience. It's a new framework with basically no usage outside of this course. I'm just going to learn how to do all this in tensorflow afterwards anyways, so it would have been nice if they used tensorflow (or pytorch) instead.

3922,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Jorge A C,"Oct 29, 2020","The course introduces state-of-the-art techniques in NLP. 
What is good about the course: (1) the Lab notebooks and assignments are well documented. Much of the material covered in the lectures is covered in much more detail in the notebooks; and the instructions facilitate very much model implementation. So much that one could finalize the assignments in a single afternoon. (2)  The reading list and web resources listed are very helpful to understand the models' intuition and how they improve on earlier NLP models. 
What is not so good about the course are the video lectures. The lecturer attempts to explain the content in the notebooks but regrettably, his efforts fall short. The script in the video lectures is too repetitive and does not explain the material at the required depth. 
After the second week I decided to skip the lectures altogether and proceed to learn the material from the labs, the assignments, and the references. To understand the material fully I watched the corresponding YouTube videos of Stanford's CS 224N.  In this regard, the Labs and the assignment served as a good complement of the Stanford course's videos.",3
3923,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Raviteja R G,"Oct 15, 2020",Explanation in video lectures is very shallow. Have to read research papers or blogs for better understanding. Lecture videos can be made much better.,3
3924,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Toon P,"Jul 11, 2022","sometimes the videos were a bit short. Instead of making 3  3 min videos with part I II and III with each and intro and outro of a minute, just make one solid video explaining the concepts. Some weeks only had a duration of 30 minutes of theory with 15 minutes of useless intros and outros. I felt like these minutes could used to go a bit deeper into the material. 

Furthermore, whats op with the names of the weeks? A week is named Q&A but actually explains al the Transformer models and Q&A is like a small application of it?? 

Last but not least, you could fill in the assignments without even reading or understanding the concept because it is just an auto complete coding exercise. Normally I always better understand the theory because of the assignments, but now I felt the assignments were sometimes useless and didn't really teach me to implement a solid ml model. It doesn't really match up with what you will have to implement if you are working at a company, I think. The assignments could be a bit more of indepented coding with a non auto-complete explanation. On the other side, I think this is ofcourse difficult to correct and thus to scale up the course. ",3

No time was spent on explaining how transformers can be used for NLP tasks using a small domain or company specific corpus through transfer learning. I'm not planning to develop the next blockbuster NN architecture for NLP and so the intricate details of how transformer and reformer works seemed like an overkill. Lastly, using Trax instead of the more production ready frameworks like Tensorflow also made it feel very research focussed.",3

For me, this course was not nearly as good as the courses in that specialization. I felt like I could have just read the papers on BERT, GPT-2, T5, and the Reformer, and would have learned the same amount. The one exception was the lecture video on the history of Transformers (the evolution from ELMO->BERT->T5, etc.). Also the ungraded Reformer labs; those were good. But I personally didn't get very much value out of all the other lectures and labs.",3
3929,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,JL B,"Nov 8, 2020","Maybe my fault but at some point in these courses I got lost in the logic and the whys of the networks constructions.

3939,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Valerio G,"Mar 24, 2021","I'm very disappointed with the whole deeplearning.ai NLP specialization in general, but this course was icing on the cake.
The course treats advanced and state-of-art techniques in NLP with neural neutworks, but the theoretical lectures are confusing and imprecise. The framework programming assignments are totally useless, since the user is asked to implement the network architectures discussed in the lectures using a ""fill the dots"" approach with a very restrictive starter structure. In my personal experience, this yielded a close-to-zero learning outcome, but a lot of frustration in trying to get around some bugs in the auto-grading system, by desperately browsing in the posts from the learners community. 
I came here after the very nice Deep Learning Specialization held by Andrew Ng and wasn't expecting this. ",1
3940,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,George L,"Apr 12, 2021","Younes is a bad teacher. He may have good technical chops, but teaching is a different skill altogether. Overall, the NLP specialization design is much much worse compared with the DL Specialization. On one hand, you were taught a lot of stuff that are deep but cursory, on the other hand, the excises are either too difficult for you to get any clue or most of the time actually too simple and you only need to enter simple parameters, therefore cannot really learn anything! I really don't know why there are so many people giving 5 star rating!",1
3941,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Yuri C,"Jan 7, 2021","The last course in the NLP specialization is intense! Already in the first week the learner is put through its tensor algebra baptism and it goes even deeper while building the locality-sensite hashing inner workings. I am very grateful to the team to have put so much effort in teaching us how attention works and how to improve it in building the Reformer model. The opportunity to get this material from some of the developers of the model is priceless! Thank you for that! Surely, in everyday NLP one uses directly the layers provided by Trax mostly. But the understanding about the drawbacks and the ideas behind these models is indeed the unique selling proposition of this whole course. The provided infographics are deeply helpful for understanding what goes on with the tensors inside the models and the instructors do the best to introduce those ideas throughout the course. I was also *very* impressed to see how much up-to-date all the material of this latest course is! Some of the papers about the models were put in arXiv 1-2 years ago. This is by far very hard to beat in any massive open online course! Thank you very much for providing this for the community at a such an accessible price tag.

3947,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Sarkis K,"Apr 17, 2023","The courses  have really enlightened me on NLP. I had no idea about the techniques. I'll give it 4 stars, because the course instructors have a monotonicity of lecturing as if reading from a teleprompter with a fake synthetic voice. It sometimes gives me a headache and I end up muting the videos and just reading the subtitles (which a lot of times don't make sense and are short paces so I have to freeze the screen, and open 2 other windows and read the lower caption text). I have been doing many courses on this platforms, and even though the instructors are on the top of their fields, but the way they deliver the courses is just ""sometimes"" and ""not always"" painful. I am sure this is not how they teach there own classes, especially in Stanford. Even though the course is 50$ per month, a think it won't cost the instructors much to show some authentic enthusiasm.

3948,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Simon P,"Dec 6, 2020","The course could have been expanded to an entire specialization. There's a little too much information and the first two assignments are disproportionately long and hard compared with the last two. It is cutting edge material though, and well worth it.
Slight annoyance at the script reading meaning the videos lack a natural flow and you end up with nonsense sentences like ""now we multiply double-uwe sub en superscript dee by kay sub eye superscript jay to get vee sub eye"". Variables such as X_i should be referred to by what they actually represent and not the algebraic representation, because this is not how the brain processes them when they are read from a page.",4

I was disappointed by the amount of lecture material - around 40-45 minutes per week in weeks 1-3 and only 20 minutes in week 4, plus two Heroes of NLP interviews. The lectures have the feel of reading from a script rather than engaging with the learner. They're not bad but there's room for improvement. Explanations are usually adequate but some areas could have been explained more clearly.
Programming assignments worked smoothly in my experience, though not particularly challenging: they're largely ""painting by numbers"".",4

[1] Teaching concepts through assignments (and not covering them in detail in lectures is) an absolutely bad idea. [2] Lecture instructions are ambiguous and immature at times. Instructor is an excellent engineer but a bad teacher is very evident from the way of presentation. [4] Only if input output dimensions were mentioned at every boundary in network illustrations, would have made a lot of difference in terms of speed of understanding without having to hunt through off-line material and papers. [5] Using Trax I think is not a good idea for this course. The documentation is kind of non-existent and lot of details of functions are hidden and the only way to understand them is to look at the code. A more established framework like Tensorflow or pytorch would have been much more helpful. 
Overall a disappointment given the quality of other courses available from Coursera.",3
3952,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Laurence G,"Apr 11, 2021","Pros: Good choice of content coverage. Provides a historic overview of the field, covering the transition from early work on seq2seq with LSTMs, through the early forays into Attention, to the more modern models first introduced in Veswani et al. Week 4 covers the Reformer model which was quite exciting. Decent labs
Cons: Videos aren't great, there are a lot of better resources out there, many actually included in the course's reference section. Trax is not a good framework for learners in comparison to Pytorch, but if you plan on using TPUs and appreciate the pure functional style and stack semantics then it's worthwhile. The labs can be a bit copy-pasty. Some of the diagrams are awful - find other resources if this is a problem.
Overall: I'd probably rate this course a 3.5 but wouldn't round up. The videos really let things down for me, but I persisted because the lesson plan and labs were pretty good.",3
3953,Natural Language Processing with Attention Models by DeepLearning.AI,Christine D,"Jan 22, 2021","Even though the theory is very interesting, and well explained the videos dive too deep in certain concepts without explaining the practical things you can do with them too very well. 
The practical stuff, especially the graded assignments, are very centered around Trax, and the only things you have to know and understand are basic python and logic. You don't really get to make your own stuff, you just fill in stuff like ""temperature=temperature"" or ""counter +=1"". 
I preferred and recommend the first two courses in this NLP-specialization. ",3

However, in this course, I found the courses did not prepare me for the HW.  Furthermore,  I found the lectures too terse, often incoherent, and the homework tried to introduce new concepts that were not discussed in the lectures.  Also, the code in the labs was poorly organized and the lack of a consistent and coherent style between assignments and even previous courses, which made it difficult to follow the logic.

I would rather spend another month to study the materials in two courses, instead of staying up late to read papers and blogs to understand what was not explained clearly in the course.

I was very disappointed that the free trial period ends before my assignments are graded by peers.  I would suggest that the course should be arranged so that students can finish it during the free period.
I am not sure if RLglue is an appropriate package to use in the exercise, as it is not as a standard tool as all practitioners are familiar with.  If the instructors believe it is something useful in the future, they should explain it more in detail in the lecture.  ",3

Well known issues with random numbers, but no updates. Incorrect book references which will let you implement formulas other than intended. Third: Tons of short videos with 30% summary and ""what you will learn"", which is ridiculous for 3 minute videos. Fourth reason: Mathematical depth missing after the first subcourse. Suggestion: Watch the David Silver and Stanford youtube lessons instead. For free and better explained.

4045,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Roger S,"May 18, 2021","My rating and review is for the entire specialization. Big compliments to the course instructors for developing a truly insightful and challenging course. Out of all the specializations and courses I have done on Coursera, this definitely has been the most challenging and rewarding one. The use of a textbook in addition to the video and programming materials is a very useful approach - to get the most out of this course, I recommend everyone to study all the material in advance of the lectures. This really increases the added value of the course.
As has been said by others, the capstone project (course 4) is the least developed. It is mostly a reiteration of videos from previous courses, and a few programming assignments (numbers 1 and 3 of which are very easy, whereas number 2 is very challenging). A drawback is that as the courses progress, but in particular in course 4, the programming exercises become quite mechanical, and mostly involve following specific instructions with a bit of debugging, without keeping proper sight of the bigger picture. Then again, I've felt this is the case for many courses in ML, and not particular to this course. 
At this point, I feel I have a pretty good understanding of the theoretical basis of RL, but I would definitely not be able to implement an RL agent independently. I guess with this basis in hand, it is now time for some more applied (self-)study in this domain. I have definitely become even more eager to do so. ",5
4046,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Jonathan B,"May 2, 2020","Very well put together course.  It does a good job of walking you through concepts in a way that's direct and accessible, while not dumbing things down.  I had bought the Intro to RL textbook some months back but ran into problems getting its material to 'stick', but the ideas in chapters 1-4 are much more concrete now.  
Assignments were reasonably difficult, but not overwhelmingly so.  Homeworks are designed to make sure you understand key concepts moreso than being vigilantly 'rigorous' for their own sake.  Emphasis of the class is making sure you understand fundamental concepts moreso than hacking your way into a working prototype of something.  
While the class is designed to be easily digested, the material assumes a working knowledge of programming and mathematical formalism, so people without some background knowledge you might struggle to keep pace, even if the material is well designed.
Also, like others have mentioned.......this class follows the book pretty carefully.  Don't expect anything to be covered that's not in the RL textbook the course is based off of.  By the end of the class the book material will be more vivid and concrete in your mind, but you will not have branched into a direction not covered within it.",5
4047,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Bon R,"Feb 7, 2024","Great! My only gripe pertains to week 4's presentation of ""dynamic programming"". Dynamic programming is a huge beast of a topic on its own, and the book chapter only scratches 0.01 % of the surface. A minor suggestion would be a better overview and example of a typical dynamic programming problem and solution. 

The course does not prepare you to answer the last discussion question: ""what are some applications of dynamic programming"". In order to answer this, you will either 1. copying answers off google,.... or 2. Get and learn from a book on dynamic programming.

Despite this one minor gripe, all the weekly modules including week 4 does give a lot  of valuable information. It's an amazing resource to accompany the RL book by Sutton and Barto, and actually helps solving the problems in the book. 

The programming question in week 4 is excellent because it they make it pretty easy, where you fill in code for a few functions. Most of the code is already coded by the course experts and all the files can be downloaded and you can analyze and learn the details of implementation on your own time. Thank you for the great resource!",5
4048,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Daniel P,"Dec 31, 2020","The course is very good, I already had some experience with Markov chains. I found the hardest part to understand was week 3 with the Bellman equations. The course should be reinforced in this part so that everyone can understand, and it would even be to pass some of the material in this section to the second week (since it is a lot of topic).  
I had to do a lot of research with other sources to be able to understand the content of week 3, since the book is not very clear material, especially on this topic. It would be very interesting if you could explain us better how to create these environments that are mentioned (eg GridWorld, Pole Car, etc) in Python in order to improve the form and intuition in the application of these concepts, this as off-topic material. 
The guest talks were very beneficial to me, they give some very interesting historical and practical perspectives on the application of the concepts. Professor Warren Powell's talk was the most interesting in my opinion and he left me wondering how we could apply these concepts to real life problems.
Thanks to the team for this course.",5

You really feel you have achieved something out of it. Some people have commented that it is just presenting material from the Sutton and Barto book. But that book is *the* text book in the subject. The course selected particular chapters from the book. I wouldn't have got as much just from trying to read the book on its own (I probably wouldn't have read as much as I did). It was good to have the supplementary videos with other experts  - and great to watch Sutton and Barto just sat down being recorded having a retrospective conversation. The programming exercises would sometimes feel they weren't testing much (in fact, the challenges were largely due to my lack of skill in Python - my Python abilities have improved which is a side benefit) but they would actually get you into the weeds as it were.

It's fascinating to see how a simple idea such as the reward hypothesis is so powerful in practice. Hearing the dialogue between Rich Sutton and Andrew Barto was very inspiring. I look forward to taking more courses in this specialization and learning more about RL.

I like the approach of combining independent reading with high-quality video content. They do a great job of breaking down complicated topics in reinforcement learning, and the programming problems help gain a deeper and intuitive understanding of the underlying maths. I think some of the proofs in the book could be more detailed. For one or two I went on line to find more step-by-step proofs. This is in principle more an issue with the book and less with the course. But I think it could be helpful if the course would provide a reference to some more in-detail proofs.

4067,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Artod,"Oct 4, 2021","Honestly, I would prefer to just lay back and consume knowledge from videos rather than reading a book full of scary math :)
Another issue is that the time allocated for reading and programming assessments is not fair: reading the book definitely takes longer, considering all that level of abstraction.
I would recommend to watch David Silver's course on Youtube after this course for generalization and a deeper understanding of the topic.",5
4068,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Mohamed S R I,"Dec 23, 2019","The material in this course is of interest or me. It combines both theories and practical aspects of RL. The course follows the standard book in RL (Sutton & Barto Book). 
One improvement may be needed is to add more ""modern"" examples and programming assignments/modules to explain the concepts. Also, it would be nice if the instructors can sometimes reflect on their own experiences with RL, rather than exactly following the book.",5
4069,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Tianwen M,"Feb 4, 2021","This course provides me the fundamental principles of RL! I like the clarity of each module (because I tend to be lost in the textbook only). In addition, I really appreciate the programming assignments of this specialization which helps me gain a deeper understanding of the basic concepts. I used to be afraid of dynamic programming, but I think I am confident enough to study more complex problems using DP in the future.",5
4070,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,x y,"Aug 20, 2020","I have been interested in RL for a while and have watched many videos taught by other researchers, but this one provides something unique that helped me really get a deeper understanding of RL and gain confidence, such as the graded exercises, the quiz, I look forward to continuing this sequence of the RL specilization! Thank you so much for making the complex concepts accessible and make the quizzes and assignments! ",5
4071,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Corey A,"Mar 28, 2022","Combined with the suggested reference, this course does a good job of giving an introduction to the fundamentals of RL. The videos are easy to follow and compliment the text well, the pacing is good, and the assignments were fairly easy to follow. I did find it helpful to supplement the assignments with additional independent exercises to fully understand the chapters covered, but I feel that was expected.",5
4072,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Yuri F,"Sep 21, 2021","Very good course, you can take it at any level, if you wish just to get familiar with reinforcement learning  you can watch the video and quickly read the book, but if you would like to be an expert you can deep dive in the book. i really like that the course follow some book which made it an serious course. could be nice to add some more homework (optional) with more interesting problem (e.g. gym)",5
4073,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Jan Z,"Aug 25, 2020","The course was very fun and informative. I really enjoyed the presentation style with clear outlines and summaries. The explanations were useful and easy to follow. Suggestions for improvements:
1) Provide a kindle version of the book, reading on screen is very tiring for eyes. 
2) I think the programming exercises could use some work from SE perspective, as some of the code is not really pythonic.",5
4074,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Karel V,"Dec 17, 2019","The course is very well organised and professionally made. Although it follows the first four chapters of the Reinforcement Learning textbook, it provides a little bit different narrative and thus serves as a very nice complement to the textbook. Most importantly, interactive quizzes, programming exercises in Python and plenty of visualisations help to strengthen understanding of the concepts.",5
4075,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,李谨杰,"Apr 26, 2020","This course is the best course I have taken in Coursera! As a learner of RL in a non-English-speaking country, Sutton's book is too hard for me to accept a new idea very quickly. However, after watching the short videos in this course that summarize the core concepts explicitly, I can understand the contents of that book easily. Recommend for anyone who wants to study reinforcement learning！",5
4076,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Christian C,"Aug 5, 2019","Exceptional course, the fundamental of RL explanations are excellent! I in particular I found it insightful the focus on thinking about examples in real-life that can be modeled as Markov Decision process. Additionally, great quizzes questions and assignments all helped in deepening my understanding of topics such as Dynamic Programing, Bellman Optimality, and Generalized Policy Iteration.  ",5
4077,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Justin S,"Aug 24, 2019","Excellent Course! The level of difficulty is perfect. It is difficult but not impossible if you do the readings in the textbook and understand the lectures. I strongly suggest reading the book before watching the lectures. This helped my understanding significantly. The material and assignments are very interesting and informative.
Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in RL.",5
4078,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,bhargav p,"Jun 20, 2020","This course will  give you the knowledge of most fundamental concepts of RL Like MDPs, Policy evaluation, policy improvement & value iteration algorithms.  Even though you follow theory well, quiz and assignment will challenge your knowledge to think  into bit more deeper level.  frankly speaking, I took some quizzes three times and at the end I learned the concepts very well. :)",5
4079,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,La W N,"Jul 1, 2020","So far so good. The course is really valuable. It'll be better if there are more explanations about mathematics used but there is discussion forums so not a big problem. It is ineffective in teaching the practicality, i.e, how real word problem can be related, what kind of problems can be solved by these methods. Overall, it is a great explanation about reinforcement learning.",5
4080,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Joosung M,"Jun 3, 2020","The content was very interesting, the instructors made things very clear that they were a great help in understanding what was really happening in the textbook.

Thank you so much for proving this wonderful specialization. ",5
4081,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Thomas G,"Apr 2, 2020","Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning is one of the best Online Courses I did on Coursera. I like that the course is based on a text book (Reinforcement Learning by Sutton), so you can really dig into the theory. Also the exercises are very helpful and ambitious which I like. I haven't found much advanced online courses which are so well explained like this one.",5
4082,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Tamas K,"Feb 7, 2023","Great course. Theory-heavy, it follows the Sutton-Barto book chapter by chapter (up to Ch. 4. in this course), the quizzes are relatively hard, the programing assignments are fun and with the given number of hints they can be done in a reasonable amount of time. I really enjoyed this one and looking forward to the next course of this specialization.",5
4083,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Thong Q N,"Feb 14, 2021","RL is not an easy topic, but the instructors made sure to illustrate the concepts with a lot of examples and visualizations, making it much easier to digest than reading the textbook.

4084,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Silvio M,"Jul 20, 2021","Outstanding course. Instructors are great. The course alternates between important readings and well-crafted videos, quizzes and assignments. As you progress, concepts get tangible and you start figuring out possible applications. Do check out the required background knowledge. I've immediately enrolled in the second course of the specialization.",5
4085,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,D. R,"Dec 4, 2019","I really liked this course. I think it was challenging and high quality. I don't understand complaints about it following the book - I found the videos, quizzes and exercises insightful and thought provoking. And besides courses are meant to follow some material and not re-invent the wheel. Am really excited for the rest of the specialization.",5
4086,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Nicolas L,"Nov 20, 2019","The course was great. Very clearly explained, with meaningful examples and backup material, such as the recommended book. 
My only comment will be on the case study given on the final programming assignment. The parking scenario was not very intuitive or clear for me. It took me quite a bit to understand what it was we were trying to optimize.",5
4087,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Jesse W,"May 10, 2020","Excellent course. Covers all the basics at just the right challenge level, assuming you've had some Python programming experience and know a thing or two about probabilities and expectation values. They provide a PDF for a course textbook which is extremely well-written, and the videos are high-quality and complement the readings well.",5
4088,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Yanis C,"Dec 28, 2020","This course was a great introduction to reinforcement learning. I found the material both accessible and applicable to a number of potential real-world problems. The combination of reading, video lectures, and example coding problems was an effective way to ""reinforce"" the course materials and build a solid foundational understanding. ",5
4089,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,MOUAFEK A,"Apr 14, 2020","After studying Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and applying them in real-life cases with some startups and companies, some aspects of day to day problems did not seem to be fit while trying to use the previous methods, thus I dived into Reinforcement Learning looking for answers, and so far it's been very promising!",5
4090,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Luis G,"Oct 26, 2019","I started to read Sutton & Barto book this summer, and although I find it fantastic, some concepts were not 100% clear to me. This course has changed it dramatically. Now every concept is clear to me. This book is like reading a book with the support of very good explanations.
Let's go for the 2nd course in the specialitation!!!",5
4091,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Jing Z,"Mar 24, 2020",You really need to understand fundamentals before kick start for any real world reinforcement learning problem. That's why this course is very essential. Plus it also provides programming tasks and multi-choice question sheet to deepen your understanding about theories. Great! Looking forward to move on for next series!,5
4092,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Tom W,"Nov 14, 2020","Really good course, and happily surprised and thankful it's based around Sutton and Barto textbook and with close links between instructors and those authors - I'd bought it a year ago with the best intentions of getting into RL, but needed something practical like this to help me get into it! Amazing work all involved",5
4093,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Shashank S,"Apr 14, 2020",This course was a great first introduction to reinforcement learning! The course instructors make the material very accessible and the course follows the textbook very closely. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone trying to understand reinforcement learning and I personally plan to complete the entire specialization.,5
4094,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Inge J,"Sep 2, 2021","Excellent introduction to reinforcement learning. The two instructors are well spoken and the material is interesting. This course focuses mainly on the math/concepts rather than having a lot of programming. That being said, there are a few programming assignments which will help you to increase your understanding.",5
4095,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,George M,"Mar 5, 2021","A very good introductory course. I agree that its content overlaps other courses on this platform. Still, the instructors never promised to create something completely different than those, so we should ignore that.
Video presenters should be a bit more relaxed to allow the audience to follow through more easily.",5
4096,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Dmitriy N,"Oct 24, 2020","Sometimes it was hard to follow. In those cases re-reading the book helped. It is nice that in videos you, guys, have solved some of the exercises from the book. Also, it helped a lot to re-cap the material by re-doing the tests (and of course by reading a helpful notes, if the answer was incorrect). Thank you!",5
4097,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Stelios S,"May 11, 2020","This is the BEST course I've taken from Coursera, period. The level of explanation, the usage of mathematically precise terminology, the walking through of the algorithms, the summaries were all top-notch. This course will be my reference when I forget something in the future. I can't thank the creators enough.",5
4098,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Ali N,"Apr 1, 2020","It was a very good course, I had read Sutton's book first. But I must say that after completing this course, I learned the concepts of the book well. Although the exercises were a bit tough, they covered the topics well and increased learning at a faster rate.
For anyone interested, I recommend this course.",5
4099,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Alejandro A Z,"Jul 21, 2020","It was really cool! Although I think there should be a forum where students could ask and answer questions. I got stuck for a silly mistake before delivering the last python notebook and could have used some help.
Still, I learnt an incredible amount of concepts that I didn't imagine were so important!",5
4100,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Иванов К С,"Aug 29, 2019","It's difficult to estimate this course because it's based on the book. I mean, 90% of materials i've seen on videos were on the book. That's very unusual, but effective. However, i've learned necessary information and python tasks were useful and interesting. I'll take the next course and will see.",5
4101,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Hannan K,"Oct 20, 2022","Solid introduction to reinforcement learning.

Also provides great programming assignments to help you understand how to implement such algorithms, with practical examples.",5
4102,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Nicolas T,"Apr 27, 2020","Great course! The idea of suggesting reading before the videos gives a huge boost to the depth of the class. This, with the ""not-too-straightforward-quizzes"", and the assignments, makes it a real deep class, from which I'll probably learn and retain more than most online courses. Good job!",5
4103,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Anton P,"Dec 15, 2019","It is a very well laid out and taught course. The instructors make the material accessible with a bit of a mathematics background, or a willingness to learn.

4104,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,DANTE K,"Dec 28, 2020","Teachers were very clear and so was the book. The only thing I feel could be improved is adding some coding exercises on Week 2 and 3 (there's only one at Week 1 and one at Week 4, with a Peer Reviewed assignment on Week 2 which was fun, but didn't feel as useful as coding exercises)",5
4105,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Sandesh J,"Jun 2, 2020","One of the best available courses on Reinforcement Learning. The instructors have explained all the underlying topics elegantly. Good blend of theory and numerical in assignments and programming problems. Moreover, the assignments have covered different perspectives on these topics. ",5
4106,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Sara S,"Dec 29, 2020","Excellent Course. Although it was only 4 weeks course, I learned more than reading an entirely dynamic programming book which might take more than 3 months for me. It was a well-presented course and I suggest this course to the ones that want to learn about Dynamic programming ",5
4107,Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning by University of Alberta,Giulio C,"Jun 25, 2020","Amazing course! 
The book, on which this course is based, is a bible for reinforcement learning. Anyway, it could be hard to understand. The lectures of the course eliminate all doubts and consolidate all the concepts, ensuring a complete comprehension on the subject.

Forums, threads, and collaboration with cohorts are disabled (not good).  Big negative are the constant social justice warrior tropes, unconscious bias, racial injustice, income inequality, NY Times view of the world, etc. that take away from the value of the material which is extremely good otherwise.  There are problems with audio, tests, and the use of paywall restricted content.  Highly recommended, but be ready for a heavy dose of politics with your medicine.

4131,Evaluations of AI Applications in Healthcare by Stanford University,Lars W,"Nov 12, 2020","Interesting subject, and very knowledgeable instructor, but the lectures felt like a lot of course materials distilled into walls of text and a lot of bullet points, with whole chapters just explained with a sentence or two. The ""reflection questions"" also felt like just repeating the bullet points. May be more reflective of me as a student than the course, but nevertheless. I would have preferred a smaller number of mental frameworks or acronyms to learn and more in-depth instead with real-life examples.  There was also an error with the final quiz. Questions 5 and 7 were identical, I gave the same answer but one was rated correct and one incorrect: 
Question 5
True or False - AI Solutions that involve an operational action paired with the outcome have greater clinical benefit thank those that have a medical action paired with the outcome

The topics include Evaluation Frameworks, Deployment Methodologies, Regulatory considerations, key considerations of fairness and bias in AI Applications, and Ethical considerations in AI. In many ways, any organization that intends to or is in the process of developing AI Applications should take these topics into consideration even before development begins. The material provided includes references to helpful frameworks and guidelines, which if used in the initial stages of the life cycle of an AI Application, would probably  help reduce lead time, as also enable the deployment usage of the application in actual healthcare settings.",4

Plus, I can now look at problems from different angles to avoid possible issues. AI has become an awesome partner in thinking up creative stuff, and it's helping me think and create even better without taking over my role. This whole experience has been super positive and has opened up so many new opportunities for me.",5
4182,Trustworthy Generative AI by Vanderbilt University,Marc G,"Dec 24, 2023","Trustworthy Generative AI should be essential for anyone trying to improve their understanding of how to maximize the use of AI and learn to think of Artificial Intelligence more as Augmented Intelligence.

Out of all the generative AI courses I've taken, they've all talked about responsibility and ethics, but this was the only one to actually point out cost/benefit analyses of using it, while also pointing out possibilities for human harm, and also, surprisingly, it's the only one that specifically points out that generative AI is NOT a place to get facts, and that you should, in fact, do a regular search.",5

Talking about how AI won't cause people to lose jobs and that it's just scaremongering is pure nonsense! I lost my job due to AI, just like friends around me. No, not everyone will find a new job to replace the current one. And while AI facilitates many useful things, the quantity of negative, even tragic, consequences is significantly greater! People fall into depression, commit suicide. Artificial Intelligence will only deepen this crisis, and I have no doubt about it – it's already happening! Wake up, people!

4218,Navigating Generative AI: A CEO Playbook by Coursera,Talia K,"May 12, 2024","I appreciated the thoughtful design of this course. The diversity of content types - expert interviews, short presentations and ""hands-on"" lab experimentation were highly effective. I also enjoyed learning from Jeff's leadership style, focusing on curiosity and an open mind to change. Embracing change is not easy, and choosing to lead rather than react is not to be taken for granted. This course encourages leaders to take risks while setting the right guardrails to mitigate risks as technology evolves and changes. Thank you for creating this course! I highly recommend it to any business leader. As a side note, despite using GenAI on a daily basis, I did not use it for this review! :) ",5

4224,Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing by IBM,David B,"Sep 17, 2019","Another course with potential, ruined by a flakey operational platform. IBM Cloud as provisioned in this course is not fit for purpose, end of story. Exercises are often impossible to do because servers, storage or proxies in the IBM cloud are down, and the instructions are not always complete either.
Sadly, the material, though informative at a very high level, is nowhere near detailed enough to actually teach the underlying integration, though you'll be well able to cut, paste and press ""Shift-Enter"" by the time you finish, even if you have no clue what the code you're executing does.
The title is misleading too - this is a Watson Visual Recogniser course. It describes this product (as a visual classifier) quite well, but it barely touches any of the ideas behind Computer Vision, and doesn't really teach anything at all about OpenCV.
Worth doing for free if you have nothing better to do, but there are better ways to spend your time and money.",1

Almost every lab is broken and people have to wait for the course administrator to respond. At the end we ourselves join the things so that it will work so on one hand its nice that we learn as things are broken but for some people its first hand to programming or IBM Watson and the image they are going to carry will not be nice.
 For the coursera I would strongly comment that this course is full of errors and how they placed this course with the monthly subscription be the big question. For me if it be free there will be some relaxation. ",3
4229,Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing by IBM,John P,"Sep 10, 2020","The target material for this course is very interesting.  The execution of the course is severely lacking.  This course is in desperate need of quality control review by someone other than the instructors in order to point out everything that needs to be fixed.
Deprecated commands are used in the jupyter notebooks.
The instructions for the final talk about evaluating furniture, when in reality you're supposed to be evaluating helmets.  The ""supplied images"" for helmet/no-helmet do not appear until AFTER the project is submitted, so anyone who used their own images for helmet/no-helmet technically gets failed for not using the supplied images, which are not supplied up-front.
The instructions for publishing the classification model to the web is full of errors as can be witnessed by the desperate conversations in the forum.
I voluntarily peer-reviewed more than the required (single) final assignment and the more that I reviewed, the more I could see that the above problems are being experienced by many with very little useful resolution from the course overlords.
Please... this entire course... have someone go through it from beginning to end and debug it.  The material being covered is GREAT, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  If this had been the first course in the specialization I was taking, I would have given up.  It's that bad.",1

Lab instructions needs to be updated. I had to depend on the teaching assistant's responses in the discussion forum for almost all of the labs. As per my observation, majority of the resolution the teaching staff provided too is to use a different browser and clear the history/cache and restart the labs. 
Much of the course talks about Watson, though the course title includes OpenCV.

I'm only halfway through it and really struggle to continue. The instructor just reads his text like a robot, transitioning from one subject to another in the same sentance and without any change in tone, making it all really confusing. It's the same for the slides: first, they are not great. And also, sometimes a slide only appears for a split second, but since the instructor takes absolutely no pause between two subjects, it leaves no time to even catch a glimpse of its content. The provided notebooks are also very repetitive, contain some errors, and contain either too many details (ex. PIL/openCV in week 2) or too little. And finally, IBM CV Studio's app seems cool, but I would first like to learn how to do CV on my own through code rather than through a proprietary web app.",2

To labs were out of service for over a week, making at least five of them unusable. The video lessons would often throw out terms without explaining what they meant, how they could be used, their advantages or drawbacks. If you are going to bring up a complex subject, you owe your audience some sort of explanation. If not, then don't use the term. I found I had to supplement the lectures with deep research on my own to find out things that could have been explained up front. The reader was lifeless, and brought nothing to the written text of the lectures. This is the worse course I've ever taken on Coursera.",2

I contacted Coursera to see if they could help, and they suspended my subscription payments, but otherwise said it was not their problem. If you have to take this course, be very aggressive about the schedule so that you have time at the end to deal with all the technical problems. Also, make sure you have a look at the Forums and try to find and/or post any issues you have; Technical Support does their best to help. There are also some ""surprises"" about how things work in the capstone project that you will only find out about in the Forums.

Some of the material was outdated where the current UI does not match the instructions given. 
In the last task, however, was the worst. After asking three times for a solution to an issue that multiple students faced, there was no response. There is still no solution after the initial question was asked by another student two weeks ago. ",2

4245,Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing by IBM,Rohit B,"Apr 1, 2020","Very good course. The last part of publishing the classifier to the cloud could not work for me. But it was optional for the grading, so was not an issue. I’d have liked it to work though.
This course really opens up your horizons to  the world of computer vision. So I’d highly recommend it to you even if you’re not doing the IBM certification as it introduces to a very interesting open source library called OpenCV. 
Some (marketing style) material regarding IBM is expected. But I felt it was a bit of an overkill (especially In the first week). Fortunately all down to studying thereafter!",5

4257,Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing by IBM,Bertrand B B,"Jul 4, 2023","Total waste of time.
The lessons are informational, the quizzes are aligned to check a rough level of basic understanding.
However the labs have barely any relationship, they are far away more advanced than the lesson: they have no learning purpose, there's nothing to experiment.
The code using open-cv and keras should eb straightforward to illustrate the lessons and experiment: both of these libraries work pretty well. However the purpose of this class is to showcase IBM products wrapped on the top of these free libraries, hence adding a level of complexity which should not exist.
Besides, some code is not working, showing that the labs were not reviewed by the staff.
I stopped at the end of the last week when it was time to ""deploy"" my app thru the IBM product. I spent zero time working on open-cv  or on a CNN or even any other ML... I spent time fighting with the wrapping  code and IBM app.
My take away based on the title of the course: ""introduction to computer vision and image processing"".. yes, that was an introduction to talk about it at the office while sipping a coffee. That's pretty much about it.",1
4258,Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing by IBM,Txomin V,"Mar 16, 2023","Not enough focus on Image Detection, Classification and Localization. Many models are already trained and you just evaluate the results. At least, you get to know the names of models that are used and how to execute the code.
The CV Studio platform is broken (which is mandatory to use) and does NOT allow to deploy the model into the Final Exercise Submission. This was VERY sketchy!
Thankfully, the Discussion Forum and Coursera Forum Moderators are very helpful!
Support by IBM on the CV Studio platform is non-existent, the do not even reply, some Lab exercises (2 or 3) are broken and neglected.

I am planning on doing the Keras route. Only problem I had was with the IBM cloud, since it is a free service, sometimes it is not as responsive as one would wish. The teachers are great, they explain with great detail everything, it is not easy to set up such a complicated subject, for people who might not have the math background to understand what a tensor is and we can use it in computer vision. I am using the resources and method for a personal project that has to do with Art, how can computer vision understand the differences between two artists.

After completing it I definitely have a much better view of GANs, their architectures, successes and limitations, and have a solid background to tackle reading papers and implementing them on my own. Thank you for making this specialization!
With all the positives (which is why I rate it 5/5) there are in my opinion things that can be improved. Especially I think there is too much hand holding for the labs, out of 100 rows of codes I code maybe 2-3%. Many of these don't give much value coding but I want to feel like I did it! Unfortunately now I am left guessing if I have truly mastered the material (and I'm quite sure I haven't, so I will need to re-implement these on my own). Also since you state that calculus and linear algebra are prerequisites then stick with it! You are trying to be too inclusive and there are several part of the courses where I thought it was entirely unecessary because everyone taken Calc and Linalg already has this knowledge.

One thing that I'd find helpful in the programming notebooks for the exercises is to add a little more descriptive material, either in text or code comments.   I was lucky that I was able to complete the exercises, but often they required adding ""print"" statements to understand what was going on.   I generally found the optional labs to be less valuable since they either couldn't be meaningfully executed, or presented contrived random results that were not very meaningful (see comments in https://deeplearningaigans.slack.com/team/U01BR86L13M for example).",4

A tutorial lab or section DESPERATELY needs to be added teaching us how to access these files after saving them -- the process involves setting up project access tokens and a cloud storage object, then importing a special IBM cloud library allowing one to save the files as accessible data assets, but this information is difficult to find online. It should really be laid out in a lab, both for the final project and to let us test the files we made at the time we make them.
Week 6, the Powerpoint, isn't great. There's been a lot of technical education on the processes of data cleaning and everything of that nature across these nine courses, but very little in terms of what conclusions one might draw from this data. I think the certificate could use a course on this sort of actual analysis featuring examples of some of the conclusions we might draw from other datasets, or even a couple freebies at the start of this project just to point people in the right direction. When it came to coming up with innovative ideas about the data, I found myself coming up with a bunch and wondering if they were ""innovative"" enough; like whether simply laying out the rankings on a particular bar chart was sufficient for a ""finding"" point, or whether future predictions about rankings were sufficient for an implication. Grade-wise I did fine, I just think a bit of practice earlier would help us not be stumbling around so much on the final presentation.",3

However, this course (it means well) is broken in a lot of places, which resulted in me spending as much time on the forums in the Capstone as I did on the course material. I would take 4 weeks of interpreting visualizations before another ""course unavailable"" or ""Watson environment unresponsive"" challenge.

If you need to do this course (like I did as it was the last one out of 9 in a specialization I was doing) - DO NOT USE IBM tools they want you to. Go with ""optional"" labs instead (unless you are fast and furious and already experienced/100% remember everything from the courses before. Trying to use IBM tools (Watson Studio) was a complete waste of time. For example, week 1 Lab on Collecting Data Using APIs I spent great deal of time and effort to figure out how to save an excel file with my results in their cloud environment in the project itself and next day - boom - can't continue ""Monthly compute usage limit reached"" and all the help one can get is ""The Watson studio which you have created under the Lite plan is completely free, as you are using the lite plan so you will have limited access to it. This will be refreshed every 30 days from the date you have created a service."". SO HELPFUL (I'm being sarcastic)! Had to switch to ""optional"" labs and spend quite a bit of time on re-writing some code bits again. Went better after switching to optional labs and making everything run locally but, of course, it initially took lots of time and effort to make everything run and to large part it was because of how the course staff is replying in forums. I see that there have been many people before me with similar problems and the answers are always somewhat fuzzy and evasive and wants to push you towards using IMB Watson or Skills Network.
In labs one suddenly had to write code never seen/explained before without any helpful examples provided.
Instructions and grading criteria for the last presentation are somewhat weird. How one would even evaluate "" Use any innovative ideas you have into this presentation"" or "" Using your creativity, make this presentation look awesome"".  Thought I had done enough and still got graded down. Peer-graded assignments are frustrating as they are and not having clear criteria for evaluating others/getting evaluated by others does not make it any better. ",2
4488,IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project by IBM,Mark B,"Aug 2, 2022","Very confusing and frustrating sometimes. Unclear instructions especially in modules 1 and 6.  IBM software glitchy, resorted to using jupyter notebook on my computer where possible. This was impossible in module 5, which subsequently took a much longer time to complete. Time spent logging in and out, in and out... Discussion forums difficult to navigate through. Page 1 of discussion results shows results 1 to 10, page 2 shows results 2  to 11, page 3 shows results 3 to 12 (??!!), etc... Text boxes for final submission: very unclear what to do here. After a long time on the discussion pages, it seems all that is required is to write ""Yes"" in every text box. What's the point? At least be clear about that in the instructions and save us all 45 minutes of searching the discussion forum. I estimate I spent 15 to 20 % of my time on this course trying to devine instructions and working around technical issues, not learning.",2
4489,IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project by IBM,Christina S,"Jan 3, 2024","There is so much wrong with this course. 
1. After using Jupyter Notebook for the past 5 courses, you are now forced to use Watson Studio. There are little to no instructions on how to use the tool, there is a limit to how much data you can use (you run out around week 4) and when you search the discussion forums, the help you receive is minimal. Any instruction you get are outdated screenshots.
2. The activities in the course do not align with the tests. In the first week I had to take a test and answer questions about a lab that came after completing the test. I only found that out because I couldn't find the data set (which they provided in a completely different course). 
3. What you do in the labs do not align with the questions you are supposed to answer in the quizzes. In week two you will be asked how many duplicate rows there are for the column, 'Respondent' except nowhere in the lab does it answer the question and you don't have access to the dataset.
4. There is too much useless information. In week one there is a whole section about job openings at Github with provided links. The links bring you to a 404 page and nowhere in the section do you use that information. It is a waste of space and time to make student jump through hoops and confuse them with useless and redundant information.

I was enrolled in the IBM Data Analyst certification and unfortunately this was the last course. The above errors were not limited to just this course but the whole certification.  ",1

4582,"Introduction to Trading, Machine Learning & GCP by Google Cloud",Carlo R C,"Jan 4, 2020","This course is a pre-sales demo of BigQuery. I thought GCP was partnering with the NY Institute of Finance to create the labs on VMs using GCP (which makes sense), but it turns out that the core information about the introduction to trading and ML is minimal, about 20 minutes of substance per week and the rest of the time is Google advertisement for BigQuery and GCP. The skewed theory from the videos ends up with a Google product guide of a specific, more skewed way of running a feature of a product. I thought this course would give me a proper introduction of ML for trading but instead is more focused on the google ecosystem. 
I would not recommend this course unless you want to learn more about Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, TensorFlow or any other google product. The NY Institute of Finance fails to deliver the theory, it seems like google is telling the instructor what to talk about so google can show and tell about its products.

Maybe passing other online courses has risen my expectations, and that it the reason I give two stars to this course. So here are my critiques to this course: 1- The contents are at different difficulty levels in this course, for example, the explanation on ML are very elementary, while the programming assignments are for advanced programmers proficient in SQL, Python, BiqQuery, ...
2- The material is not coherent. It doesn't start with general and straightforward explanations and then gradually elaborate on the details—3- The method of lecturing. I had to close my eyes while listening to some of the lecturers because the way of lecturing is very unnatural, and it is a distraction. Sometimes watching the presenter helps in learning because you can connect to their mind, but sometimes their hand movements, gestures, the way they look at the camera, and all these things are simply distractions. 
But I must also mention some advantages of this course. 1- You will learn about some keywords on the topic of Trading using ML. You can generally understand what's going on in this area and what are the tools being used. 2- You'll find some links to useful resources so you can self-study and go through the direction you desire.
Anyway, I am sure this course will gradually improve after feedback from learners.",2

Some minor complaints:
Audio quality/volume was a mixed bag, would be nice if they normalized audio across all videos.
Painful process to use the 'QwikLabs'. I mean, you couldn't make a clunkier user experience if you tried.
The course felt like an ad for Google products in parts. Instructions for how to use the Google products are now old so lots of menus have moved or changed names. So, not a very good ad because everything seemed more difficult to use than it should be.",3

Granted I can research that on my own, but more guidance would have been appreciated.
More broadly, this course feels a bit chaotic, jumping from one topic to the other, and then getting back at a previous one. This is ok to explore the fundamentals, which is clearly the intent here, but more structure would be welcome. Particularly, the introduction to Jupyter notebooks coming at the end of the course, after three labs, feels a bit frustrating. On a similar note, the course really feels like (and clearly is) something that was patched together from bits and pieces of other courses, with often times instructors referring to ""previous"" topics that were not actually covered (e.g. random forests).

It's like they had to put together *something* for a 4 week course, so each part of the team got one of those weeks, ... and no one ever got together to review the overall gestalt.

Earlier I was simply learning about a new technology for the technology sake, not having a real idea where, how and why the technology will be used. This course has been real eye opening for me. Giving me a clear idea about how to think about a technology and how to approach a problem. A Great Learning experience and I am thankful to the instructor Robert Monarch, the team at DeepLearning.AI and Coursera.",5
4710,AI and Public Health by DeepLearning.AI,David M,"Jul 7, 2023","This is a high-level course about project strategy more than project coding. The instructor does an excellent job outlining the essential elements of judging whether an AI solution is appropriate for the task.
There is code to learn from, however! The notebooks employed in the course use some great tricks for coders to learn from!
One refreshing element was an early case study where the conclusion was that the AI mechanism applied was more trouble than it was worth! Fortunately, others were able to build on the experience of that project, and go on to achieve some success. However, it's important to learn the lesson that not all problems are nails for your hammer-only toolbox.",4
4711,AI and Public Health by DeepLearning.AI,Veronika M,"Jul 22, 2023","Quite surprisingly, the lecturer of the course ""AI for Public Health"" provided as one of the first examples a project that has failed due to a bad user experience. 
It was unexpected for me that so many projects actually would not need AI, as although it is a powerful tool, it is one of many possible. Therefore, the first question we should ask ""Could AI add value to my project?"". My last year's experience with ML also brought me to a scenario, where I realized the amount of samples provided by the client was not enough to characterize the material of the quarry. On one hand, no magic happened, on the other hand, it was still a result with a clear outcome.
I would recommend the course for someone who already works in Data Analysis and is interested in environmental topics, or for environmental specialists with basic Python knowledge, who would have an opportunity to see step-by-step how the data is analyzed and visualized in clean well-organized Jupyter Notebooks. The code is already there, one can just run it and play with the inputs a bit, so the programme is rather informative than challenging.",5

The framework for the development of AI projects was very helpful since it considered the stakeholders and defined the problem as well as walked you through how to consider the data at each step.

If you're going to make the Python portion of the course optional, don't add difficult questions to the quizzes and final exam.

The labs are amazing, as they really help understanding the models and how to use them. Some recommendations:- I really like the way that the course is structured and that you are beginning with naive and easy solutions to come up with better ones, but sometimes it wasn't explicit enough that they where naive solutions while you were presenting them. Therefore it was a bit frustrating because during the first videos, i was always like ""Oh man why is he doing that? I have a better way!""... only to realize that you were about to present something better afterward -  Too many pure computation questions in the quiz... I find it useless to have questions with a formula and the data and we only need to understand how the formula is applied... It is too easy and it doesn't help understand deep meanings and explanations.- The quizzes are not mandatory to pass the course and they should be!- When a model is presented in the video, you could also explain how it is going to be trained, because sometimes i didn't know if some weights that you were talking about were learned or were just hyper parameters (ex: in basic models exemples of week 1)Another example is at final week, in the video 'survival tree', you manually split the data but you don't explain how the survival tree will be trained, now that we don't have a labelled outcome 1 or 0 associated with each patient.- It is not stated if the models and solutions that you are presenting are the state of the art, or if we should investigate more.- It would be nice, for each course, to have an exemple of solution that is already used by some hospitalsDon't hesitate to reach out to me if some of my recommendations are not clear enough...

It is clearly explained, there is even too much hand-holding. When the instructor shows a (very basic) integral and reassures us that even if we don't know what it is, we will be alright, he is pushing it too much. Anyone who hasn't seen an integral like that before is not in the audience of the course anyway. 
The projects are very interesting and relevant, it is a pity they have been dumbed down in the execution to the point that we are required to fill in missing lines at specific places.

For example, I enjoyed very much all those side steps in material  which Andrew did in explaining and giving an intuition to the things directly not related to the subject. He is a person with very wide expertise and this seemingly not related material brings most of the enjoyment I bring home from his courses. Now it is gone... The course is still good, but now it lucks its magic ...

4900,AI for Medical Prognosis by DeepLearning.AI,Hugues D,"May 11, 2020","Hi,
Great course. Maybe I missed something but the explanation to calculate the C_Index does not cover all cases and so the assignment is rather complicated. The Harell's C-Index algorithm is given here: ""https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/what-is-harrells-c-index/"" and it helped me a lot.
Thanks again for course. See you at the next one.",4
4901,AI for Medical Prognosis by DeepLearning.AI,Erwin J T C,"May 22, 2020",I liked this course. Some of the concepts appeared  somewhat abstract but I'll just have to review integration and derivatives.

4903,AI for Medical Prognosis by DeepLearning.AI,Karl J,"Sep 24, 2020","Good introduction to these materials, but it's difficult to use this level to incorporate into research.

4911,A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data by University of Pennsylvania,Kilder U,"Nov 7, 2020","A must for anyone interested in causal effect estimation. The professor is throughout with the content, he doesn't go too fast and too slow, and relies heavily in explaining the intuition behind the methods. It'd be great if he could do a second course on this with the more advanced topics mentioned but left out, like sensitivity analysis for propensity score, IPTW and IV, that are requiered for those writing papers.",5
4912,A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data by University of Pennsylvania,Mateusz K,"Dec 8, 2018","I enjoyed the course and learned basics of causal inference. What I missed was more exercises with R in order to gain more practical understanding of the material. In particular, it would be great to have exercises where you get some dataset and your task is to calculate given causal effect and you need to come up with an approach and to execute it. This would mimic more closely problems that you encounter in practice.",4

4920,A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data by University of Pennsylvania,Theo B,"Jul 3, 2017","In the beginning the course to me was quite difficult, as it has a different perspective on statistics I was used to. Most people tend to say: ""correlation is not causality"". When it came to propensity scores, matching and so on the possibilities became more clear to me to apply these methods in practice. The pace of the videos is slow, so I played the videos in 1.5 of the time. What I missed was the ability to download the slides. The instructor would look into this, but we're still waiting several weeks later. Another thing I missed was any sense how many other students were in the course. ",4

4937,A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data by University of Pennsylvania,Scott M,"Feb 17, 2022","The course material is excellent, but the course description dramatically under-estimates the study time needed to complete the course. This is especially true for the R assignments if you are not already *very* comfortable in R.  There are also many problems with link rot and software/version compatibility issues for the R exercises. 
I would have given the course 4 stars were it not for the unforgiving nature of the R exercises. 
Overall, I would recommend this course for someone if they are already quite comfortable in R, or are willing to pout in at least 20 hours of work for each of the R assugnments. ",2
4938,A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data by University of Pennsylvania,Siyu H,"Feb 15, 2021","This is a very theoretical course with much math formula and less well-explained practical examples to better illustrate those formula.

Better than other courses on causal inference on coursera. However, some of the topics (e.g.  within the IPTW and IV methodologies ) were presented in a sort of general manner (intuitive). Which is obviously not a fault of the instructor and is due to the strong research nature of these topics. Personally, I can't think of presenting, for instance, 2SLS or insights on IPTW in more detail within a crash course. Perhaps, increasing the number of weeks to 6 or 7 in order to include more detail on, e.g.  2SLS would be a good idea.

I like how there is little ""fluff"", you learn a lot for the time given and I don't feel any of the concepts covered are unnecessary or esoteric. The only negative is that the course could've benefited from more practical assignments. There are 2 R code assignments: could've been more.

5056,Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras by IBM,Marc A T,"Oct 23, 2022","I really like this course as it has only provided me with the tools that I need to understand neural networks without overhelming myself with abstract mathematics or theories. It is indeed good to be equipped with foundational theories and mathematics, but they do not build much intuition without direct practice. I believe that theories can be learned along the process rather than being stagnant because you cannot grasp them initially. With this course, I have become proactive because this is more concept-based and the mathematics has a good visualization to it. I like the way it is designed and how the final requirement aids you while allowing flexibility.
This course is highly recommended to those who have a background in Python programming, and interested in the basics of neural networks without the exhaustive mathematics.",5
5057,Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras by IBM,Frank S,"Nov 23, 2021","This was a good course and well paced.  But I have a comment about the final project.  It was not clear to me if the same model was being re-trained and improved upon in 50 trials - or if the idea was to do 50 trials to capture just how good a model it is, using different splits of the data.  Since we were asked to find the mean and sigma of 50 trials - I assumed those trials would be independent and each one performed with a fresh model - otherwise it is odd to find a mean and sigma of a system that is converging to a final result.  In that case it's only the final mean and sigma of the final trial that matters.  So I think some clarity would help there - without giving it all away with regard to how to do the project.",5

5158,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Shireen K,"Aug 17, 2020","The instructions didn't match the functions many times. Nothing built upon each other - We would learn ""IF"" functions once and never use them again. The instructions for the final projects were not clear at all. I once spent 50 minutes trying to figure out what to do on a final project just to find out that the instructions were on the answer page (which I don't look at until I'm done). This course was a waste of time considering I found myself looking half the stuff on Harvard Business Review for more information on what a specific function does. Obviously the syntax is important but if I don't know what it does and what it's used for, how am I supposed to know when to use it? Finally, to top it off, this is listed as a beginner course meaning no prerequisites or prior knowledge is needed. However, when beginning week 4, the instructor says that people should have knowledge of statistics before beginning. How is that a beginner course if it's pretty much required to know a bit about stats (and finance) before beginning.",1
5159,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Ong W H,"Feb 21, 2018","A good course exploring important functions and video will guide learners through easily. However, it is extremely frustrating that the culminating exercises at the end of the week is extremely hard, at times, impossible to follow. 
The instructions are unclear and there are mistakes in the answer tab provided. Should learners be unable to follow, they would have to seek help from the forum and we understand that many face similar problems too. 
Weekly culminating exercises are the most challenging, yet, the most rewarding. It is a compilation of excel functions to sum up learnings for the week. If PwC can pick up the slack, it would greatly improve the experience of all the learners. Learners can also consolidate their learning and test their understandings. 
I was expecting more from PwC, a little disappointed. ",3

The best part of this course is the hands-on approach--every module has an accompanying Excel worksheet so that you can work along with the instructor. Followed with exercises for students to do on their own. The solutions provided are very helpful in this process. The end-of-week assignments are actually challenging and exciting. ,5
5166,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Sacha A,"Nov 5, 2020","Really useful training, lot's of meaningful functions (vlookup, index(match) & text functions).
Good to learn formulas in english too and get familiar with them (I was french Excel user).",5
5167,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Ian,"Dec 6, 2016","This is a pretty good intro to Excel course. It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 (it seems like some of the worksheets weren't checked for errors), but it never wastes your time. It's a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly-used professional functions in Excel. I'm glad I took it, though I do wish there had been more of a progression. For example, it would have been nice if there was a final, project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4.",4
5168,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Chutian B,"Feb 22, 2019","Great for a beginner, especially for those just starting their career life as an intern. Also a wonderful enlightment for data analysis and related fields. I'm considering a more analysis-oriented major after the undergraduate. What should be fixed: Some instructions are so wrong that the forum has given clear tips, but they haven't yet been modified in the course",4
5169,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Joel B,"Mar 26, 2020",I've learned a lot and love the format of short videos and hands on approach. I regret however that this course is getting outdated (2016) and that some excel sheets are full of errors (see Week 3 final) which have been reported more than 2 years ago (see forum) and still not corrected.,4
5170,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Sameer P,"Nov 17, 2016","The course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quizzes and some errors in numbers. And the formula bars in the videos (i.e. formulas within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein. Participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors. Though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned. Otherwise the course was great and I would recommend it to others for the knowledge. ",3
5171,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Sheerae O,"Apr 29, 2020","This course content is great but the delivery made this course challenging to get through.  For instance, the videos were a bit difficult to follow with at times since some instructors went too fast and there were also some display issues. Also, i felt like there needed to be some practice exercises to tie the concepts together prior to the final projects for each module. Apart from this I learnt a lot and this knowledge will improve my work.",3
5172,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,MingxiXue,"Jul 12, 2019","The course definitely expected the learner to know some basics about excel, stats, and finance, since the presenters did not explain everything piece by piece. It was helpful for me to learn some excel tricks and easy functions, but some answers to the quizzes were wrong and nobody seemed to be responsible to fix them. In addition, maybe the tutor for this course doesn't work any longer because nobody answered questions raised in the forum. ",3
5173,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Jaspreet O,"Jun 25, 2018","It is a good course on Excel basics. The quality of the Videos was poor even at the highest available settings, due to which it was impossible to follow the steps and formula from the videos. I had t o rely on the Worksheet examples. PwC also needs to do a proof reading of the workbooks as there were several typos. Overall a good learning/ refresher of the many analytical formulas, functions in Excel.",3
5174,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,James D S,"Jan 24, 2018","A basic Excel skills course. Some of the exercises have errors, or use formulas which aren't fully introduced in the videos. May be frustrating for some who don't feel comfortable troubleshooting the answer sheets to find out why their correct answer differs from the answer sheet's incorrect answer.",3
5175,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Nihad A,"Oct 22, 2017","Concepts were introduced, and some were refreshed. But exercises were missing, instructions were missing on certain functions and the answers in the ANSWER KEYS were mostly Wrong.

3. The instructions for the final projects were not clear at all... some mistake I found
4. In the Week 4 module some lessons may be missing or incomplete

5182,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Arjun,"Jul 13, 2020","For those enrolling into the course, beware!!! 
This course isn't a smiple course for anyone beginner. There are various elements that would make you regret getting yourself enrolled. (Don't Waste your Money) The following points are a few of them and I beleive coursera removes any negative comment against the course. 
Negatives:
1. This course is very very old. Don't expect it to be updated. PWC expect you to have a basic understaning of the course.
2. The discussion forum is dead. No replys to your doubts. (Just dont think of checking it out)
3. Weelky problems are the worst of all. You will be taught the basics, but weekly problem aren't in the same level as what has been taught.
4. Comprehending of the weekly problems. It is in a differnet language all together.
5. Key lesson are missing in this course. 
Postives:
1.It is curated well. There is more excerises for anyone to learn the basics.
2. Guided problem solutions.
Hope you consider such reviews before going forward. ",1

I wish though, so that when recording formulas and computations the author would zoom into it so that we could see small number at a better resolution. That is THE ONLY complaint... I have a 27 inch imac and I had to go full screen and zoom in but then the quality would drop and I had to guess in some cases. 
But that's about it. Besides that - loved it!!! Will repeat it again and practise all over to memorize it better! ",5

5190,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Alex M,"Jan 12, 2018","Yet another great course by PwC, engaging videos and well built exercises and quizzes. 
I have to take a star off for the lack of polish on certain materials. Spelling mistakes were frequent in the written materials, and numerical or formula errors did exist in some exercices of certain excel sheets. To be fair, none of these occurences were major or really disturbing to me, we all make mistakes, and I was noticing them and finding my way around the problems regardless. It's just that you expect more polish when you've gone through some of the other courses PwC offers on this platform (the sound quality on the screen-cap segments not being that great also... )
These things have to be mentioned so the course can be improved, but as of right now it's a solid 4/5 that does exactly what it says. The overall experience is great, you won't be dissapointed.    ",4
5191,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Katarzyna S,"May 28, 2018","This is a nicely structured and informative course that fulfills its purpose. It is a good introduction to how to use Excle in more powerful ways; I did not feel like any special knowledge was needed until the last week when the course touched upon statistics and finance (though it provided explanations in a user-friendly fashion). In some videos audio quality is pretty bad; there are also minor mistakes in practise spreadsheets (most of them already pointed out by the community), hence I gave this course 4 stars.",4
5192,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Chris Z,"Sep 13, 2018","Overall, a great course. I certainly have learned a lot and applied these skills into my professional life. I docked a star because there are certain items that could require some attention in the included excel downloads. For instance, in Week 3's comprehensive problem, the formatting for the pivot tables was off, leading to a lot of frustration. In addition to being asked questions that were not covered in the weekly materials. Like I said, great course, but has a couple of kinks that need to be addressed.",4
5193,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Fred S,"Feb 24, 2017","I learned something new every week and the projects at the end of each week were thoughtful and robust. Overall, well worth the time.
Frustrations - sound quality varied widely and could be frustrating.  Would have preferred significantly more examples, was difficult to really grasp some concepts with such limited practice and implementation examples.  Found mistakes in some portion of nearly every week's lessons, which makes it challenging to learn new material and one week was particularly sloppy.",4
5194,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Jingting X,"Apr 19, 2019","Very hands-on and clear instructions, being precise and practical. The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is that there are many errors in the handouts and excel forms, such as duplication, unmatched answers versus questions, which are all stupid mistakes.

5195,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Mrinal K,"Jun 8, 2020",The course was well structured and amazing student exercises but the audio quality in week 2 and some parts of week 1 was so poor that I had to listen to what the instructor is coveying again and again.

5196,Problem Solving with Excel by PwC,Cristina P M,"Feb 5, 2018","Very good course. Well explained and to the point. If I had to make some comments about improvement, I would say that sometimes the final assignments are not connected to what has been covered during the course.

5409,Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals by Google Cloud,Emem M,"Jan 13, 2019","Multiple labs had issues loading. In particular, any labs that required me to open ungit in Datalab would hang for extended periods of time or fail altogether. I would have to reload or reopen the Datalab pages multiple times just to be able to click to the next section. These assignments are timed. The amount of time wasted was not critical to my project success, but they were very frustrating to complete.
The last lab (before the final module quiz) simply stopped working. I closed the lab and tried again. I closed Coursera and tried again. I closed my browser and tried again. I restarted the computer. After 4 attempts, this process just became too frustrating to be work fighting with - especially since my employer wants me to compare Google Cloud Platform to Microsoft Azure and choose the one that works. 
After working with GCP in this course, I can say that the Google Cloud Platform has exceptional features and API support. However, I have no reason to fight to learn the Google Cloud Platform if the course fails to load key aspects of the Platform in a reliable manner.",1

This is why e.g. a 30 minute tutorial on deploying a deep learning model on a VM/CMLE, with pipelines in dataflow would actually take a few days to figure out. 
For the courses from GCP to be really effective, a section with gotchas is needed: how does that work in real scenarios, like VPNs, security, package management, dataflow packages conflicts, limitations of language choice (e.g streaming and python)
Also, it wouldn't hurt to make the code cleaner. The repositories are a mess and the spagetti shell scripts, honestly, aren't the best idea.",3

I found that this course has the required material one should get to do hands on. I have seen people in my organization who says that they have given other cloud certification but they didn't do hands on. And these people who hasn't done hands on are unable to implement there knowledge in real time scenarios. For example if you have to schedule a job that loads the data (daily) from Datstore (GCS) then these guys says to open a bigquery and to do it manually. Whereas one who has done hands on will schedule a job and will call a wrapper (shell script or Python code) that will do this activity without manual intervention. The one who has not done hands on says why you are running Bigquery from Python or shell script. I am very much found of this course as this course connects you to the every possibility of connecting GCP with real world applications.

5453,Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals by Google Cloud,Felix E,"Oct 26, 2017","TL;DR: I sadly have to say that this course was absolutely not worth the time. I would recommend anyone looking to get started with Google Cloud to just go through the examples in the Google Code Labs, since you'll get about the same information in a much smaller timeframe.
I can't recommend this course to anyone for the following reasons:
(1) For the most part, it feels more like a Google self promotion than an educational class. 
(2) Most of the content in this course is based on the exercises from Google Codelabs (or rather, they link you to the exercise on the google platform), which themselves are all right. The video lectures, however, rarely add anything of value, definitely not with respect to the amount of time they take to complete. Overall, a rather low ""production value""/""-quality"" compared to other courses in Coursera.
(3) The course attempts to showcase how easy some complicated tasks are in Google Cloud Engine. However, you're just given the task to execute long and rather complicated scripts that Google has provided just for this course. Those scripts and what happens in the background is not explained in depth, instead it's often emphasized how easy everything is with GCE. No mentions of what to do when you DON'T have a huge amount of code already provided by Google.
(4) The course content is not adapted well for the Coursera format. Around 50 chapters, partly only with 15 second videos, so you have to scroll a lot and it's hard to see how content was intended to be grouped. The tests/mutliple choice exams are also very badly done, feels like they were made with the lowest amount of effort possible.",1
5454,Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals by Google Cloud,Ekaterina P,"Jun 2, 2018","Very raw. Have to restart labs several times, because sometimes they just do not work. Just that (like there should be a button(exists in video), but you can't find it). Very frustrating. Not to mention that for your own money they are advertising google-cloud to you... :)
Google cloud itself is buggy for now...
On technical side of the course: it is made to maximize the number of sections and videos. Just like some ... code that maximizes lines of code. Yes, it's like 10 second videos in the separate section. Many of them. I like short 3-10 min videos, but 10 second ones? Labs that officially take 1h, but if google cloud is not bugging it is 15-30 min. Labs where instructions tell you to stop half way through, because the rest would be in the next lab!!! (so you would have to redo those steps, yeah). Probably maximizing the number of labs too... Lots of frustration!",1

5460,Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals by Google Cloud,Nikhil M,"Jul 17, 2020","In this course, I learned How to use the Google cloud platform(GCP) and it's tools like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Vision, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, compute engine, etc.
In GCP, we can generate the instance of Virtual Machine(VM). It's a serverless platform (Google has it's own data centers). We can develop a complete software through GCP.
IN GCP, we can build custom models. It is very handy to operate for BigData. The Data in GB, TB, or PB can be processed in seconds or minutes on GCP.
Also, I deployed the ML model for Classifying Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML.
In this model, we classified the Images of clouds in three categories., viz cirrus, cumulonimbus, and cumulus.
The cool features of AutoML and Vision API-
-We don't have to write code for building the machine learning(ML) model.
-AutoML decides the dataset splits for training and testing.
-If you are working with a dataset that isn't already labeled, AutoML Vision provides an in-house human labeling service.
- We have to just evaluate the model by adjusting the Confidence threshold and the confusion matrix.
Sometimes the training time will be more because of large datasets, node training time as well as infrastructure set up and tear down.
Though it is cost-efficient because you have to pay for the memory you use, The time processing takes place(for Training the nodes in ML), etc.
The bottom line is GCP offers IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) in the form of Google Compute Engine, and it offers Paas (Platform as a Service) in the form of Google App Engine. As for FaaS (Function as a Service), GCP offers it in the form of Google Cloud Functions.",5
5461,Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals by Google Cloud,Aditya D,"Jul 22, 2020","I am fascinated to learn how Google Cloud successfully builds applications that use our big data and machine learning products.

We basically do all the hands-on stuff only 1 time, so there's no hope of remembering it or getting good at it.  We're drowned in all this IT security stuff that everybody in the real world knows it's the report writer's concern.   That's IT security and we follow their rules.   That's their problem.  You should be designing training that produces good report writers but you blow that off like it's 1 of 100 things that matters.

It seems that Microsoft is trying to make Power BI look more complex and difficult than it is!!! The other major issue is the mistakes in the Capstone Project assignment. In almost every step there is either a mistake or the information is not quite clear. And since there is no help from the teachers or Microsoft, you have to figure it out yourself!

 Lectures:    4.0stars 
Quizes:    4.0stars 
Programming assignments: 4.5stars 
Book (Sutton and Barto): 4.5stars 
 In the spectrum from the theoretical to practical where you have, very roughly,... 
(1) “Why”: Why you are doing what you are doing 
(2) “What”: What you are doing 
(3) “How”: How to implement it (eg programming)… 
...this is a “what-how” class.  
 To cover the “why-what” I strongly recommend augmenting this class with David Silver’s lectures (on Youtube) and notes from a class he gave at UCL. This covers more of the theory/math behind RL but covers less on the coding. Combined together with this class it probably comprises the best RL education you can get *anywhere*, creating a 5-star combo.

5694,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Aaron P,"Aug 10, 2019","I already expressed this to Coursera, but I'll reiterate here. This was a terrible ending to the specialization.
Let me make this clear, I loved all of the previous courses before this one. This time around I noticed very untypical characteristics. 
For one, the teaching staff was very rude. In this course, the came off as argumentative with sarcastic undertones to virtually EVERYTHING posted in the discussion board. Two of the staff members in particular, Tamara Brunnock and Stephen Catto, were very unapproachable and combative. I remember asking for someone to take a look at my assignment for grading, to which I was met with Tamara commenting ""Did you not read the assigned reading? You need to allow up to three days for grading. Is 5 hours three days?""
What kind of a response is that? In fact, I wasn't even asking for a staff grade, I was asking for peer grading! To which she ARGUED back ""I doesn't say that anywhere in your post."" 
The interactions in this course are VERY unsettling. If I feel shy or feel as though I'll be verbally punished for asking a QUESTION, what does that say about this organization? 
This is a course I sacrifice finances and time for, so I expect quick ANSWERS to my questions, not arguments or sass. ",1
5695,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Morgan S,"Apr 7, 2016","If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt. 
The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll ""build applications"" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper. However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities. If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class. 
The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.
In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of. Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.",1
5696,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Brendan C,"May 2, 2019","Very poor quality course, both from a content perspective as well as from an implementation perspective. 
This final class in the specialization is not a programming course. You are instructed to run someone else's code and screenshot the various stages of running these scripts. You don't modify their code and it really takes a step back from the previous courses in this specialization as the instructions and the course staff's direction are significantly misaligned. 
I was evaluating this course for use in my organization, but cannot suggest taking the capstone as it provides no value and is simply a waste of time.
My suggestion to improve the course would be to align the staff direction with the instruction given in the course. Additionally if you read through the forums you can see them get frustrated like they are volunteer staff working for free in a hostile environment. ",1

5699,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Christopher L,"Feb 26, 2020","I am extremely disappointed with how this class was setup.  Basically, you had to do next to nothing to earn the certificate for this class.  There is a single 26 question quiz (taken in week 1) that just covers basic Python information from the previous 4 classes in the specialization. There's no class videos or assignments other than the single quiz to gain the class certificate. The question set was not challenging and it didn't deal with much of the detailed concepts that were presented and learned in the previous 4 classes.  What is the point of doing this???  
Now this class is a 7 week class and there is a separate optional honors program (with a note on your final certificate saying that you completed the honors content) that requires the completion of 3 additional peer-graded assignments.  There are some videos covering a little new material and some reading but no quizzes.  I really don't get it.  What makes a fellow student, learning this material like me, capable of fairly assessing my work on larger scale programs that should be part of a capstone course?  And what makes me capable of assessing the work of others fairly?  Obviously, I'm not a big fan of the peer-grading concept, I feel it is just an excuse for the course creators to excuse themselves from grading which is an important component for learners.  I've completed the class and got my certificate and the certificate for finishing the Python for Everybody specialization.  But I really don't feel all that good about this since I was required to learn nothing new nor complete any capstone work to receive the certificates. For my own well being (and to help me with future Python work), I'm in the process of finishing all of the honors work now so at least I'll have gained something from this class.
There is also a push by the class creators to pressure students into working together and that's the reasoning they've given for leaving this class so open-ended.  I get that (and agree there is some importance to that concept) but this is supposed to be a capstone class, where you put many of the aspects of your previous learning to work on some more real-world problems.  And to get some guidance on how best to apply your new skills to real problems.  How can you get the class certificate without doing that?  I feel all of the optional honors content should be mandatory and the class structure (quizzes & assignments) should be similar to the other 4 classes in the certificate program.  Make sure the students you graduate are ready for the work that lies ahead.  You wouldn't want it any different if you were the student.
I also feel this setup diminishes the value of this class and the associated specialization certification because students are required to do next to nothing in this last class (which should be a milestone and help lock in all we've been exposed to throughout the first 4 classes).  So when possible employers see that you've completed this specialization, there's got to be a question whether you actually did any capstone work and put some programs together using all of the skills learned. In my opinion, the capstone work is a very important part of your completed specialization and should be a required component for everyone who completes the specialization.",2

I tried to asked help for both coursera help center and in the course forum, but still did not get enough peer grade.
Because of this I did not finish the last course of the specailization, and have being charged for extra 5 or 6 month......

5716,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Raffaele L,"Oct 26, 2022","A very disfunctional and disappointing finish to the specialization.  The first 3 courses built off of each other and the textbook provided additional explanation for topics.  Moreover, there were exercises at the end of every chapter to test the learner's knowledge.  Overall, the first three courses were heavily hands-on where we learned to write out own code.  
Contrasting this, course 4, and course 5 (captsone) were very different.  Important topics and new knowledge was glossed over very quickly, and the difficulty of the programs increased significantly more than the level of the students' current knowledge.  The programs were actually so difficult compared to our skill level that assignments started to involve simply copy and pasting pre-written code, making slight changes, running, and screenshotting output.  Gone were the days of writing out own code apparently...This is no way to learn.  
The captsone...WOW.  Basically the previous paragraph but even worse.  Same logic, copy code, run it, take screenshots, submit.  Apparently coursera and University of Michigan think that this constitutes knowing how to code.  Given that the specialization capstone is advertized as something that we will upload to our portfolio, it is concerning that UMICH thinks that this is appropriate.  No employer will hire you simply because you have the certificate, or an application in your portfolio that you merely copy and pasted without knowing how it works.  Not only this, but I was actually automatically unsubscribed from the capstone because I finished the week 1 quiz and coursera gave me my certificate before I had even begun the capstone project.  The fine print that I failed to realize was that all you have to complete to get the certificate is to complete the quiz, the rest of the course, the ""Honours Track"" is optional.  What I did not realize was that it was one or the other...I was under the impression that I could complete the quiz and upgrade to the honors certificate after completing the rest of the course, I was wrong.
Overall, the first three courses I learned a lot and felt confident in my abilities, but the last two courses progressively got worse.  Its a shame really.  I really enjoyed the first three courses, but the last two including the capstone left me disappointed and discouraged.",1
5717,"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python by University of Michigan",Jeffrey R,"Jul 7, 2020","I loved the other courses in this specialization but this one just really didn't make sense with the others. Before we were learning skills at basic levels and combining them to make bigger and bigger code. I was excited to write a more in-depth program for the final project especially since it said we would make something using our own datasets. It turns out it just meant running already complete code on targets of our choice. The videos were just basically reading line by line complex blocks of code larger than anything we have made, lots of glossed over stuff like java script files, very confusing naming of variables in the python code. It's like we just learned how to drive and then someone put us in the passenger seat of a racecar and is like ""look at you you're a professional racer!""",1

Since the course relies on quite a bit of peer-graded as well as instructor-graded assignments, you need to leave ample time (up to a week while course is running) for grading completion. Some instructors may be unfriendly when asked to expedite. Do not attempt this course if you have some sort of deadline and are short on time.

Before my enrollment, I was deeply impressed by the fact that you're so courteous and generous to allow everybody to use your precious teaching materials (books, slides, videos, etc.) for no charge. I thought to myself, ""Not so many people do this these days, who is this guy??"". After watching the first video, I could not stop ever since. Your presentations are outstanding and quite engaging. Your sense of humor is amazing. The effort that you put into your slides never went unnoticed. The writing style of your Python book is very nice. Everything you say or write shows how passionate you are about your work. But, what is even more impressing is the amount of time and effort that you give for no charge to help others. Obviously, you could have made thousands of dollars if you used your time and efforts otherwise, but, fortunately, you chose another route, which, in fact, pays off in the long run.

For the uninitiated, the Nasty Dungeon is an area in the Game Boy RPG Final fantasy Legend 2 that's really long and filled with toms of difficult monsters, only you don't have to actually face it because you can just walk in, go a few steps to the one treasure you need, and walk out. Of course, doing so deprives you of the level ups and treasure you would've obtained going through it, and you'll find yourself unprepared for the future if you skip the dungeon.
This class works the same. If you just want to complete it, all you have to do is start it up, do an easy final exam for the specialization, and there you go.

I struggled to understand and had to print all over my sample of the code to understand more whats happening, the teacher is great but given the amount of time explaining the code was so little he couldn't explain enough and even with that it's aways better to make the students make their own code line by line understanding the logic behind by themselves.

Who would have thought that all of that could be explained so well?
I must say that I did have to watch some videos repeatedly and build my own code along side, to understand the material. To really know the material, I do feel that building alongside Dr Chuck, and then creating your own stuff, is probably the best way to get the full worth of the knowledge. And I still have to build up my GMANE example...so more work to be done. But I'm done with the videos, and they were all excellent!
I started Harvard's CS50w in the hopes that I could finish that and build my own web applications, but the backbone for taking that course is that you know Python already (and HTTP, HTML, CSS and Javascript). 
This sequence of Python classes is EXCELLENT. I've tried many other python classes, but never really got it. Dr Chuck explains everything so well that I understood everything this time.

The course was very interactive and interesting. The assignments and quizzes were on point and had a very good check of our knowledge. The resources provided were very good and informative. The language of professor was easy to understand and he is a great teacher. Python is a very updated language and has a vast amount of usage in different fields of Computer Science. The concepts taught in this course have touched on most of the things we can use python for. I am even looking forward to taking if there is any continuation to this course by the same professor.,5

The overall flow of the class is excellent, starting nice and slow, for the fundamentals, and building up to challenging yet fun projects. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone looking to learn about python. I also recommend doing the full Capstone portion, as it has some in-depth tutorials and fun projects to show you even more of what python has to offer as a programming language. ",5

I actually like the way this was put together. I think it's great having the code and various scripts available to take a deeper look at how they interface with each other and the output from each  script.  Too see the dependencies and tweak the code to produce other results.  It's taking the initiative, putting into it what you expect to get out to further enhance your skills in coding with Python.

The statistical content, including the lectures and book, are very good.  The structure of the first four weeks of the course is very good.  I recommend students follow the syllabus (videos, etc.) in the order shown--one week I tried the homework without viewing the videos first and it made it more difficult than if I had seen them.
I was very disappointed with the final project, because it required much more R expertise than was explained in the rest of the course.  The ""example project"" was useful, but not sufficient.  The specific requirements for the final project (e.g., two of the three subjects must involve and analyze three variables vice two), were not clear or easy to find.  An additional week or lectures in the final week covering R tasks such as how to make an HTML document and project expectations would be helpful.",3

Even my bf who is an economist who uses R regularly had to take a half hour of googling just to set up R for the quiz to be usable. Before he came over I was just having a horrible time full of crying and remembering the trauma of computers eating my homework as a kid. Worst class experience of my life. And you call it a beginner course? With that little guidance? Seriously there is so so little about setting up R. I still feel so angry my time and energy was wasted like that. And I was so excited for this course- I'd been gearing up for weeks and was very very committed to finishing.

While the course content was well organised and succinctly presented in the videos, questions on quizzes and labs could at times be phrased in a confusing manner (even for a native English speaker), and the labs did not prepare one for the finesse with R required for the peer-graded final project. For the final project, I would recommend establishing more specific conditions (e.g., the number of visualisations expected, suggestions as to variables to explore in the dataset, and the points to consider in narrative sections), especially for an entry-level course.

I think it would be improved by adding one week to the course dedicated to solely data analysis in R, as a precursor to the final project. There was too big of a gap in terms of R practice (for those new to R) between what was explained during the course and the final project. I would have found it super useful to have one more week in which to discuss how to treat missing data, how to clean data in R (even if just a simple cleaning, like getting rid of the NAs), followed by steps/do's and don'ts when analyzing data, different types of graphs in R appropriate for numerical and ordinal data, that sort of thing.

5835,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Breno S,"Sep 16, 2018","I would give it 5 stars if it was truly for zero beginners. I myself didn't have much problem understanding the content, but I can imagine that people with no background in statistics would have a very hard time. Some very important concepts are just glossed over. Another problem is that much more attention is given to the mathematics behind the stats, as opposed to how to conduct the tests themselves. I'm finishing the 2nd course two (inferential statistics) and I have the same feeling there. We spend video after video learning the nuts and bolts of the math behind, but at times we are only given the code in R. Sometimes the code is not even given!! The same with ggplots. The real-life applicability of the knowledge here is to make sure you are able to use the software to run the analysis. It's important to understand the logic behind, surely, but no one will, professionally, do the calculations by hand. I left this and will leave the second course (Inferential statistics) with the feeling that I've learnt much more the maths than how to actually use R.
One final thought: at times, in stats, the most difficult thing is to decide which test to implement. There are possibilities, but which one? Why? How to I check for Skeweness in R (the number, not the histogram). What is considered too much skewness? What is too large a bias in bootstrapping? These are just examples of precious, directly applicable information that's left out ",4

I did mine on Datacamp and had to refamiliarise myself with the RStudio platform for the final assignment, which was slightly painful as more things had to be set up (and time may not be on your side by then). You can use the commands learnt in the course for the final assessment but many classmates seemed to go above and beyond. Online resources are truly indispensable and I'm amazed that I can make decent educated guesses as to what certain lines of code do, in order to improve the chart!",4

Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel
) is absolutely incredible & clearly extremely thoughtful of what the students know, don't know, and should know. To get a stronger grip on statistics I took this course alongside Stanford's ""Introduction to Statistics"" as well as University of Michigan's ""Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python"". Doing all courses at the same time is definitely helpful, but by far this course had the most clear, informative, and applicable information. 
1) The use of diagrams to explain concepts was a great way to visualize data. 
2) The examples used are all relevant and give dynamic interaction between you and statistics. 
3) The assesments were very well made and at the appropiate level when compared ot content. 
One thing I will note is that the R introductions aren't extremely beginner friendly, and I still managed because I've been coding with R for the past 8 months. BUT, it's still very doable as long as you can do a crash course on R on a website like codeAcademy beforehand. 
Thanks for the incredible course!",5

Regarding the homework, the difficulty of quizzes is well-set (not like some quizzes in other courses that are too easy or confusing). The RStudio assignments are not bad, though I think it should have been much better with video guides (or at least video reference); a wall of code and text is not friendly to beginners.
A side note is that math is not heavily used in this course; it is not a theoretical statistic course for disciplines like computer science or physics. if you are seeking for solid mathematical deduction this is not the course for you.",5

The sound isn't normalized from lesson-to-lesson so you have to turn up the sound for some and down for others. In certain videos, there are incisions of audio segments, re-dos, which don't have sound normalization easier. An easy fix.
The R itself is taught through text. The videos (in terms of content) are great for people coming back to statistics who've taken it before. The supplemental textbook readings probably aren't necessary for people with familiarity. I give 3 stars because my next-day motivation of 'let's get back to it' is not there.

The labs in Weeks 1-4 were very difficult and there was almost no guidance on how to complete; I struggled through them by finding solutions on StackExchange, etc. But the worst was the final project in Week 5; the material in Weeks 1-4 was absolutely inadequate to prepare the novice user of R. Furthermore, the assignment is ""peer graded"", meaning you will not receive instructor feedback--fellow novices will attempt to provide feedback on your work. It is the blind leading the blind.

5854,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Alexander C,"Jul 16, 2020","Before you start this specialization you should check the start date for the final capstone course and make sure that it aligns with the time you anticipate wanting to take it (add a few days for the annoying bottleneck of getting peer reviews back for your assignment in course 4 since you will not be allowed to enroll in course 5 until all of the first four are completed).
When I made it to the capstone course there was a full month until the start date so all of the assignments are locked until then. I am far from the only one this happened to. Others on the forum for the course are complaining about two-month waits. This seems like a naked cash grab since the specialization is a monthly subscription. Honestly, it would be better if they did just surprise you with an extra $50 charge to do the capstone because at least you would have the option of paying and getting started on finishing up the specialization.
Otherwise, the specialization isn't really maintained any more. For the first three courses it doesn't matter much because it's all pretty easy (my rating for the first three would actually be two stars as stand-alone courses probably). In the third week of the fourth course the instructor is swapped out for a new instructor who is utterly incomprehensible, using terms and ideas that haven't actually been introduced. The accompanying text is similarly incomprehensible. I say this as a math person who has subsequently gone to other resources to learn this specific material. The problem is not that the material just gets harder, but that the quality of instruction drops through the floor. So beware of that.",1

Taught at high school / college freshman level (one of the exercises was writing mean and standard deviation with Greek letters -- pure busywork). The textbook inaccurately described a data set with several different data types as a ""data matrix"" a word usage that conflicts with both linear algebra and the statistical language R.

Warning to physical science students: This is not in any way a criticism of the course but there are no examples from Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, or Physics.  Only health and social science stuff.  I would have liked to see course content applied to something like data acquired from a telescope such as TESS or Hubble but that's me.
The forum for the last week is clogged with requests to have final projects reviewed, detracting from the intended purpose. I do not agree with having lower division students review each other's work: student maturity level to assess and give feedback is lacking.  But, I knew what I was letting myself in for.

5859,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Gabriel B,"Feb 18, 2018","Very impressive course, certainly among the top five I've ever taken online. Course design is basically flawless. The lectures are clear, concise and based on interesting examples. The course also comes with a textbook for which you can pay what you want, even a price of zero. The textbook is also very well written and contains plenty of examples to illustrate concepts that are introduced and lots of practice problems too. This is crucial for developing a good understanding of the material taught in a course like this.
I do have one warning about this course, however. The learning curve for the programming aspect of it is very steep. It says no previous knowledge of R is required, but I don't think I would've been able to finish my final project if I hadn't already taken about 15 other courses (mostly on DataCamp) that focused on R programming. At the very least, you should take the free Introduction to R course on DataCamp before you start any of the labs for this course. Ideally, you should also get a DataCamp membership and work through about 60% of the courses on the Data Scientist with R track before even starting this course.
I realize that sounds like a lot to ask, and that I am contradicting the course description that was written by the instructors, but this course makes use of a great deal of the knowledge that is taught on that track, especially the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, from the first module. Dplyr in particular is a wonderful R package that does things I've always dreamed of while struggling to do basic things in Excel, but it takes a lot of practice to get the hang of it you will get much more out of this course if you already have some experience with dplyr (and ggplot2) before starting it.",5
5860,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Rui Z,"May 6, 2019","I've audited several similar courses and found this one to be the best. 
First of all, Dr. Mine is just so great at explaining things. There is no doubt that she's one of the best in her area, but she's also born to teach and communicate. She combines all kinds of way to make a concept vivid and clear. I've audited couple other courses, and I took relevant courses back in college a while ago, Dr. Mine is the best out of all the professors I've met at explaining things. This is not in this course but next, but just as an example of how clear she is when explaining standard deviation of sample means. She takes time to combine a specific example, visualization, and simulation,  to really make all the points clear. You could try to listen to her on that part in the next course week 1. 
Second, the R practice in every week is very beneficial and helpful. The cases used in those practices are fun to work with too. The hands-on experience on R and data exploring is valuable. 
Overall, this is a very helpful course for me to review probability that I took a while ago in college and almost forgot, and for me to learn R and get hands-on practice. ",5

This course really gives me some confidence to continue to study probability theory, after finishing this specialization.
Textbook: The textbook used in this course is a good supplementary material, although it is not necessary to read the textbook. Course videos have already explained everything that we need to know at intro level. The textbook also covers some extra optional topics that are worth reading.
Course Structure: The course structure is well organized with clear focus in each week.

The use of RMarkdown was not that easy, but somehow manageable with trial and error, and the knitting to html was also a little cumbersom. 
My main problem was that the week 5 assignment was not very clear and demanded more from the inspiration and creativity of the student in coming up with original research questions than on how to handle them and put them in R. As a consequence, the line of thinking risked to be reversed: first you realize what you can handle in 'R' and then, you create a question that can be handled... Perhaps, I would have preferred a first research question, formulated by the teachers, where only the concepts and programming already taught are to be used, before letting us free in the wild. Another consequence of the total open question is that the more fancy assignments that I could review, were those that used more R packages/commands than we were supposed to know already...

I have struggled for years to understand and get the hang of statistics, at uni, with online courses and at work. With this course (and the following courses) I think I have finally gained a DEEPER understanding of some of the basic but very important concepts of statistics. Lots of detailed examples and no overly complicated maths gibberish (although still mathematically sound!).  
The R programming bits run in parallel to the statistics lectures and can be followed (necessary for a certificate) or can be ignored (if you only want to grasp the concepts), but are overall very easy to understand and follow. There is only little background to R as a programming language and the different types of data, lists, matrices etc. To me that's a good thing, as it allows you to use R right away (which in turn makes me more motivated to go back and learn more about R).

The textbook that accompanies the course is freely available in pdf format online and the suggested exercises are a great complement to the rest of the course materials.
For those unfamiliar with R, the project is a bit of a leap from the rest of the contents in the course. To get around that, I'd suggest to both use the discussion forum (posts by mentor David Hood are particularly helpful) and to take both the R programming course and the Exploratory Data Analysis course from the Johns Hopkins data science sequence. Those 2 should together be doable in 5-6 weeks and at that point you should have sufficient background to where doing the project in this course (and those in follow-up courses in this specialization) should not be a problem.",5

I first encountered R markdown files in this course and have used them constantly ever since.
My only tiny point of criticism is that the non-graded exercise quizzes are way easier than the real quizzes, and do not really prepare you at all to the more complex questions in the actual quizzes. It's a petty and unimportant kind of criticism in an otherwise wonderful course.

Para quienes no saben, desconocen o no han tenido contacto con markdown valdría la pena ver un par de vídeos en youtube. Yo manejaba algo de R, pero nunca había tenido contacto con markdown y me pareció una herramienta muy útil, y aunque no es explicada en las lecciones o en los talleres, el proyecto de final del curso debe ser hecho en markdown.

I recommend that students read the book chapters and do the practice problems there, it's very helpful. 
My one criticism is that the amount of R taught in the course is not really enough to do a good job on the capstone project, because the data in the given database is formatted very differently. I think maybe the course staff could reformat the database to make it more user-friendly for beginning R users, but in the meantime you may want to study a little R on the side at, say, DataCamp.",5

The suggested problems, quizzes, labs and final project were all fantastic for reinforcing the content learned and actually putting it in practice (as most of us learn best by doing).

The book, OpenIntro is also very helpful in this regard.

It took me around 10 hours a week of dedication, and the Final
Project of the last week required around 40 hours of work. I am
very pleased with the final result, but I think it is important to let it
clear the real time expected of effort here. Unless you are already really
familiarized with the concepts and with the R platform, the
course requires a strong commitment. My final verdict: I
am very grateful to have done a course of this quality from
where I am. Thank you: professors, mentors, developers and fellow classmates! Every
minute of my time was worthwhile with you. ",5
5877,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Neringa B,"Oct 5, 2017","Introduction to Probability and Data (by Duke University) is an excellent course. It's like a beautifully and clearly presented piece of the history of statistics. This course must be taken by all who are interested in the type and dynamics of relationships between various elements of life. At the same time, the duty and responsibility of mental reality (=ideology) is to reflect the actual reality. The dogmas of the traditional statistics revolve around a traditional family model which excludes present day gender diversity. This makes traditional statistics no longer reflective of the actual reality unless it incorporates gender diversity. ",5
5878,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Blaize G,"Sep 4, 2019","Very rigorous course. No you don't need programming experience to complete, however you will be thanking your self if you spend as much time throughout the week learning R as you do on the content of the course. I was stuck at the week 5 project for a while until I buckled down and spent a few days on Youtube and on Google learning R. So with that said, if you have no prior exposure to programming or Stats, this course is very difficult, however if you stick with it, it is very worth the time spent. My tip is to reset your deadlines as many times as you need to if the content is more difficult than you anticipated.",5
5879,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Tanika M,"May 18, 2020","I really enjoyed taking this course. The accompanying book builds builds and teaches the concepts very well, and the videos are great resources to help solidify the readings. There is very occasionally some tricky wording in a quiz question, but it is barely an issue. Like many other reviewers, the Week 5 project stopped me in my tracks at it felt very daunting, but I then found further information from instructors/mentors on the forums, which were a great help (I would suggest maybe sharing some of the forum information in the project description, or linking to the forum more clearly for further support). ",5
5880,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Eugene Y C,"Feb 23, 2017","The course was well-structured and the instructor clearly illustrated statistical concepts to students who have no prior experience in the field. Although the lab assignment for each week may seem a bit stressful for beginners, the overall learning is highly inspiring and does prove rewarding as students finally get to apply the technical skills to their final project. Also, the guidance for each lab assignment was very helpful. It would be even better if there are example code answers for the lab questions, since some of the questions are a bit more complicated. Overall, this is a worth-taking course. ",5
5881,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Marwa A E K,"Jun 18, 2019","Though you may feel at the beginning that the pace is somewhat fast, but you'll learn a lot if you stick to the material and worked on the labs and the hands-on tutorials. Not to mention the project example in week 4, it was incredible I really liked learning through the errors and interpreting what are these errors and why they may arise. In the project I learned a lot, I felt it's not an easy task to start working on a dataset from A-Z with complete freedom to formulate research questions, clear the data and get the appropriate inference! Overall it was a great course that I really enjoyed :)  ",5
5882,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Deleted A,"Jun 15, 2017","I really enjoyed this course - the instruction and materials were high quality and very helpful in clarifying statistical concepts that had seemed unnecessarily confusing to me prior to taking this course. The assignments were very helpful in teaching R, with the final assignment requiring slightly more familiarity in R than the first 4 weeks prepare students for. My advice for students who take this course is that if you have the time in the first 4 weeks, try to learn a bit more than is minimally required in R to be best prepared for the final project. Overall a great course!",5
5883,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Bharat K,"Jul 19, 2016",One of the well made MOOCs. There are many courses in Coursera taught by good professors from good universities but are badly designed for an MOOC environment making it a bad experience. This course is really well designed. The contents is modular and lectures are split into easy to grasp chunks. The weekly lab exercises using R using real datasets is a plus. Though not much of R syntax is taught and it is up to us to explore(understandable since the goal of this course is not to teach R). The final project was a bit challenging but fun. The course 'mentors' are helpful. ,5
5884,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,William S H,"May 18, 2020","Very clear and simple to follow along with.  This allowed me to brush up on and formalize my stats knowledge a bit more, but I have no doubt that it would be good for a complete newbie.  The lectures are succinct and comprehensive and there is a free online textbook for reinforcement as needed.  Moreover, the R labs and project really add a LOT to the course, jumpstarting my knowledge of R, R studio, and how to perform some exploratory data analysis.  For prospective data science folks, I recommend taking this in conjunction with The Data Scientist's Toolbox.",5
5885,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Mark F C,"Jul 1, 2017","Great intro course into both stats and R.  I especially like how the videos succinctly explain all the concepts in such short lessons, supplemented by the thorough readings that provide more details and the lessons in R.  
The data analysis project, while challenging at first, did a good job of providing an interesting data set and forcing us to come up with the rest.  If I had my hand held all the way through, I wouldn't have learned as much as I did, as I was forced to look throughout the internet for code to perform functions I was anxious to use.  ",5
5886,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Derpmaiden A,"Apr 10, 2019","This is an excellent course to lay down the ground works for further courses within the specialization.

While certain area of the course, especially week 5 data analysis project, can be challenging. Know that the discussion forum is always there to help you if you are stuck. The quiz and project is never outside the scope of the course materials. Totally would recommend this course for anyone who interested in statistics.",5
5887,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Erin A,"Oct 18, 2019","This course made principles of probability interesting, going beyond the usual examples of coin flips, dice rolls, and card draws. The discussion about the limits of which observed trends can be applied to a greater population of interest was clear and the project gave us an opportunity to put it into practice ourselves. I especially liked the opportunity to ask questions of a large dataset and generate tables of data and graphs to illustrate these tables a bit more clearly.

The free textbook (written by the instructor) that accompanies the course is likewise excellent.  If you watch the lectures, read the book, do the problem exercises at the end of each section of the book, you will pick up an excellent grounding in statistics.  ",5
5890,Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke University,Lenka B,"Apr 24, 2020","I enjoyed the course very much. I appreciated that the course was teaching practical skills that we could immediately apply to solve problems using real data. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to explore a big dataset from a US survey, formulate my own questions and actually get some answers! Although I found some of the assignments challenging, and I spent on them more time than expected, it was worth it. I guess it helps to know some basics of R programming beforehand. ",5

I was taking this course bit lightly for being the introductory/basic course but I have learnt a number of new things: Introduction to some stats terms I overlooked/haven't learnt before like p-test and confounders, the incredible example of data-counterfeiting in the academia and how PCR and next-gen sequencing technologies work. Although I couldn't learn in depth, which is obvious since its first of the 8 course specialization, so I am anxious to take the next course - this specialization is looking very exciting.",4

5957,Introduction to Genomic Technologies by Johns Hopkins University,Piotr G,"Jun 8, 2020","The initial lectures on introduction to genomics are very engaging and good starting point for everyone who slightly touched that topic before and is interested in both history and recent developments in the area.
The week focusing on software engineering doesn't seem to be a good fit for such training. Most of the content is dedicated to extremely trivial computer science topics hardly related with bioinformatics. Only last several minutes give examples of bioIT software and systems.
The week with statistics is good only if you posses solid knowledge on statistics. Then it serves as a good recap. Otherwise you might be completely lost 5 min into the content, e.g. there are much better explanations of p-value and family-wise error out there in internet than the one provided in the course.
The idea of a project to go through a research paper and answer the questions about it was fantastic! Very good way to cement what you learned.
Overall: 3 stars. I would give 4 if not for trivial and rather useless computer science intro. At few points, the pace should be adjusted (e.g. statistics).",3

I am a man of 58 years old and having an experience of almost 30 years of Business Management of Pharmaceutical & Nutraceutical Industries of Pakistan. Presently I am having my own Consulting Company "" AIMMS CONSULTING"" and extending my services as Management Consultant to different companies of said sectors.
I am of the conviction that learning is never ending and have a habit of learning new ideas about my favorite subject about Data Science. Although I have the limited usage of this subject in my working areas but I love to know about new areas of different specialties.
I really appreciate highly the efforts of Prof Steven Salzberg, PhD &  Sssociate Prof Jeff Leek, PhD and enjoyed the course material and videos presentation of this course. Mind blowing approach was adopted especially in the conceptual background with extremely useful Bioinformatics, Computational and statistics in the course of Introduction to Genomic Technologies.

Thanks & best wishes to all Coursera Team.",5
5985,Introduction to Genomic Technologies by Johns Hopkins University,Benjamin W,"Nov 7, 2023","This course was a very helpful introduction to the field, and mostly enjoyable to take. I appreciate that Professor Salzberg eased in the biological component in such a way that a lay person would come away with a routine knowledge of DNA replication. The cursory explanations of algorithms and software design I found engaging, as he does a great job translating the logic of something that seems conceptually out of reach to most people, to something anyone can make sense of. The statistical component was the most challenging, and I personally would have preferred some refresher on the mathematical side of things. Professor Leek's lectures were excellent, replete with examples translated to everyday life, so if you pay attention, everything would make sense to literally anybody. This course made accessible to me a field I've always wanted to pursue but felt beyond my reach. I look forward to the next course in this series.",5
5986,Introduction to Genomic Technologies by Johns Hopkins University,Marta K,"Jun 9, 2016","I highly recommend this course for everybody who has literally no biological background and would like to learn something about Molecular Biology and Genomics. 
I have tried to learn a little bit by myself a few times in my life but for every try I ended up with some endless clicking at next and next definition from wikipedia, not knowing what is crucial and what I can skip to get a general idea about the subject. Everything but not a successful way of learning. Here, they give you the essence in an understandable way, together with some of these ""interesting funny facts"" from the field that, added to a lecture, make you more willing to stay focused. ",5

It has helped me understand what is going on in the laboratory that I am working at. It is a good course for me because we are planning to put up a molecular biology laboratory in my Department. It has helped me conceptualize what are the things that we will need. The course made it easier to understand with the visual presentations even though I am not familiar with bioinformatics. Ideally we will be doing sequencing as well on our research and it is a good thing that the course introduced new technologies as well that are cheaper and more efficient options.

6069,"Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau by University of California, Davis",Mykola S,"Aug 24, 2016","This course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week. Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant. 
Secondly, practical assignments are very poorly planned: 
1) in weeks 3 peer graded assignment students are asked to save Tableau workbooks as twbx files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableau Public that is used in this course. The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau. 
2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.
Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.
Overall, this course is just a waste of time. For comparison, you can easily get more useful information about Tableau from the 4 minute long ""Getting started"" video on the Tableau website than from  this course. Just wonder how Coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform.",1

I got completely opposite grading from two different people, meaning one is clearly wrong but both count as my 'grade' - don't bother with this course, save up a few months and go to a real course where you can speak to the teacher and don't have depend on morons scoring your assignments.

Since number of enrolled students may vary, ""peer review"" type questions makes it difficult to get a grade. Even if you've submitted your assignments, if there is no one to review your work, you don't get a grade. This is disappointing and very discouraging.
 I request the course creators to consider this and try to make the tests such that learners can complete the course on their own. I believe this would motivate students to complete the specialization.",5
6073,"Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau by University of California, Davis",Rohit B,"Apr 24, 2020","This is an excellent course on fundamentals of visualisation. Mixing the title with the word ""Tableau"" may give the wrong notion of the course content to the students (did to me at least). Ok, I am a bit harsh here as there is indeed some introduction to the Tableau Public variant. However, it is very limited. So many students may give up due to mention of Tableau (without being a Tableau course).
That said, I have now attended courses 2, 3 and 4 already as well. So I consider myself reasonably familiar with Tableau. My suggestion is the following:
1. Do this course even if it disappoints you along with course 2 (goes on the same line). 
3. By end of course 2, you would learn some very cool concepts around the visualisation topic and some very interesting background reading materials. Note that the time mentioned to read the background materials is heavily understated. It took me a lot longer than 10-15 mins that they stated as recommended time to read it.
3. Once you hit courses 3, you would suddenly start realising the true power of Tableau. That course is awesome.

6074,"Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau by University of California, Davis",Deleted A,"Jan 19, 2018","I found this to be a disappointing course.  Yes, its an introduction and you can't do much in an intro course... but...
The Tableau parts have no real added value on top of what's available for free on Tableau's site.  
The Week 3 assignment was very frustrating, it was poorly worded and the instructions to export didn't work for the Tableau Desktop that I had installed as per the course instructions.  The assignment should have been a consolidation but it was the first time that we played around with data sources.
The Week 4 assignment did not use Tableau at all.
It would have been much better to have had one example to follow through from start (obtain data, prep, import) to creating a Visualisation that was part of the course work.  Then add some assignments that allow you to build on what you've already seen.
In terms of visualisation terms and concepts, this was very light and relied on some other well known (& readily available) material.
As the content was very light I was able to finish the course in a lot less time than the course overview estimates, well, everything other than the confusing Week 3 assignment.

The worst part is that they stop you in the middle of lectures to quiz you about material that has not been introduced yet, expect you to memorize very nuanced Tableau details and fluff material for the quiz. You can get much more detailed material on Youtube for free, or even at Udemy for a fraction of the cost. I actually regret wasting my time on this course.

Sure you can toy around, but for such you can download Tableau Public and toy with it yourself and not losing hours to find that just 5 or 6 videos are really talking about Tableau and the rest are chit-chat talking (once and again, once and again) about Colors, Lines, and Charts. Quizzes reveals all the magic: Do you expect quizzes to be asking you about Tableau? Sorry. 90% of the questions in the Quizzes are asking you about Color theory, Principles theory, and Brain theory. That says all. Welcome to the Psyco-world. A joke.
This is really dissapointing. And when the course ends, you will discover that you don't know nothing about the Fundamentals. 
Run away.",1
6113,"Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau by University of California, Davis",Ellis B,"May 10, 2020",Instructors are great but the peer graded assignments are TERRIBLE....  You can't get any answers on the most basic questions and everybody is just begging to get their assignments graded...  That is literally all that is on the discussion boards...  They have also changed Tableau so the assignments don't even line up right..  Tableau seems to be awesome but don't recommend this course because it is a little time in instruction and a lot of time dealing with stupid stuff on peer graded assignments...  I am dropping in now..  Very disappointed...,1
6114,"Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau by University of California, Davis",Amber O,"Nov 21, 2016",I'm sorely disappointed.  I learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that I didn't get a good feel for Tableau. I paid $20 elsewhere (UDEMY) and I'm learning a SHIT TON about Tableau through them. Tableau has great free resources too that are better than what I paid $80 for on Coursera. This class is a joke and not worth $80.   As a UCD Alumni I'm embarrassed my school's name is on this.,1

You have to be begging other course takers to review your assignments. I don't have time to beg anyone to review my assignments.

Do not take this course until they eliminate these peer review assignments from the course. ",1

The content is high quality and compact. The course is highly recommended for professionals who have limited time to keep up with the state-of-the-art in GANs. I feel that the course has given me enough knowledge for me to find ways to apply these skills for good in the industry.
Areas for possible improvement: 1. Some of the lab exercises put focus on the wrong areas. In some cases, I feel like I was spending time on tensor manipulation instead of learning the important nuances of the algorithms. 2. I would love to see the course extended. It's relatively short and I think some of the advanced optional content could be incorporated into the standard curriculum. What I value most from this course is how it condenses and simplifies concepts. The optional content leaves the reader to self study and doesn't help with accelerating learning. Insights that help the learner understand the architecture differences, improvements as well as the pros/cons of the GANs referenced in the optional content would be valuable.",5

6251,Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Nikita K,"Apr 5, 2021","The specialization contains excellent theory, but is extremely lackluster in the assignments department. If you are fluent with PyTorch - you will be fine. If, like me, you're only familiar with Tensorflow or other ML libraries - it might be a struggle.
The course itself provides next to none code explanations. A  lot of practical assignments end up becoming excercises in reverse-engineering their testing code. Reading through all the questions on Slack, I am far from alone in this. Some code cells give you tasks along the lines of ""you gotta do this, there are a lot of ways to do it, so do it somehow"".
Bottom line. Was the course useful? Yeah, I will implement things I learned here in my GANs. Was it a pleasant learning experience? No, it was frustrating due to a glaring lack of code explanations.
All it would take to make it much, much better - have an extra video per week which would go over putting the new theory into code, like many other courses here do.",2

6261,Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Aladdin P,"Nov 21, 2020","I've just completed the specialization and my thoughts are that everyone should take it (that are interested in GANs! I feel Sharon is a great teacher and the entire team did a really good job on putting togethor these courses. After completing it I definitely have a much better view of GANs, their architectures, successes and limitations, and have a solid background to tackle reading papers and implementing them on my own. Thank you for making this specialization!
With all the positives (which is why I rate it 5/5) there are in my opinion things that can be improved. Especially I think there is too much hand holding for the labs, out of 100 rows of codes I code maybe 2-3%. Many of these don't give much value coding but I want to feel like I did it! Unfortunately now I am left guessing if I have truly mastered the material (and I'm quite sure I haven't, so I will need to re-implement these on my own). Also since you state that calculus and linear algebra are prerequisites then stick with it! You are trying to be too inclusive and there are several part of the courses where I thought it was entirely unecessary because everyone taken Calc and Linalg already has this knowledge. I would prefer instead if you spend this time making other videos where you go in more depth, perhaps going through some of the difficult math etc. Hopefully you try to improve this for future courses done by deeplearning.ai",5
6262,Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Kyle M P O,"Jan 3, 2021","This was the most challenging of the series so far. It was really great at not hand-holding as much in the programming exercises you that you get a better learning experience of actually struggling through creating your loss functions and compiling your neural network. If I could add one improvement, it would be to include some sort of capstone project wherein we would be required to implement one of the GAN architectures taught (DCGAN, StyleGAN, PatchGAN, or CycleGAN) in our own dataset or perhaps a different dataset. This would be quite challenging as the code would not be provided in terms of how to compile the network and training loops needed. This may also serve as a final challenge to figure out if we have really conceptually absorbed the different architectures and their respective limitations/implementations.",5

6333,Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Steven W,"Feb 27, 2021","I would have preferred the assignments spent more time on the training loop, and talking about what's going on with the cost function.
One of the interesting things about GANs is that your cost function is different for different parts of the network. This is really really important to the workings of a GAN, but we never touched the training loop after the first assignment in course 1. I feel like we should have spent more time nailing that training loop down. 
Also, I don't think any of the classes mentioned the importance of the fact that the cost function is learned, rather than explicit. That's huge! You can do that for any network, not just generative networks, and it seems applicable to all kinds of less-supervised ML. It seems a waste that they didn't draw more attention to that.",4
6334,Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by DeepLearning.AI,Ernest W,"Jan 9, 2022","Overall it was good but the final assignments were very confusing in my opinion because there are so many things going on there I still don't understand.

Some optional notebooks definitely worth to be part of the lectures for more motivations, such as pix2pixHD probably as one lecture. The specialization could potentially divided into several more courses with more detailed and technical lectures.

6347,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Sandeep M,"Sep 23, 2018",The content of the course is good but the assignments are in matlab which isn't as widely used as python and has the additional headache of licensing. it is the assignments where you really learn things so this is a serious negative point.,2
6348,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Max B,"Dec 20, 2020","This review is for the whole Specialization, not just course 1.  The lectures & subject matter are fascinating, but the course itself has some serious limitations:
1) Two of the most common example problems the instructor uses are image segmentation & speech recognition, both of which have been completely superseded thanks to neural networks (CNNs for the former, RNNs for the latter).  The course was written in 2011 or 2012, and the lectures haven't been updated since.
2) The textbook is extremely useful, but they do not provide a PDF, though it is easy to find via Google.  The professor does not give explicit ""readings"", you just have to find them on your own.
3) The Discussion Forums are effectively dead, nobody involved with the construction of the course has gone through them in 4 or 5 years, and most learner comments are several years old as well.  In other words, you're on your own as far as figuring things out.
4) Quizzes & exams have no partial credit, often have ""gotcha"" questions, and enforce time delays between attempts (1 hour for quizzes, 24 hours for exams).  
5) By far the biggest problem however is the programming assignments: they must be done in Matlab/Octave.  I've taken many other courses outside this Specialization, so I say with confidence that the lion's share of the learning occurs in solving programming assignments.  In the 3rd course especially, the programming assignments are exactly the same ones assigned to students taking the course in real-life at Stanford, where it was assumed that students would work together in groups to solve them.  They are not of a reasonable difficulty level, from a pedagogical standpoint, for a distributed, asynchronous, online course.
All of these problems ultimately stem from the fact that this was among the first courses on Coursera (Daphne Koller is one of the founders of Coursera), before they really understood how to properly convert between a university course and an online course.  Unfortunately, where Koller's colleague Andrew Ng has put in a lot of work updating his Coursera courses, Daphne appears to have abandoned this (to be fair she is very busy running companies doing fascinating work).  
I recommend Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization and University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Specialization for learning ML content, though the former can be quite hand-holdy at times.
Good luck,

6350,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,A M,"May 1, 2019","The material is really important and helpful for many concepts of Machine Learning. Daphne Koller is very good at explaining complicated ideas in an intuitive way. The programming assignments are very relevant and cover many real-world application scenarios in medical diagnosis and testing. Unfortunately, programming assignments have many flaws. First, some scripts do not work and therefore it is necessary to manually adjust these in order to submit your assignment part by part. Second, the forum is almost dead, which means that is is difficult to get help once you are stuck at a problem. Most of the helpful posts are almost two years old. Third, often times questions in the quiz are very vague and not clearly formed which makes it difficult to answer the instructor's question. All in all, I think, that the course is worthwhile but nonetheless the course definitely needs some refurbishing and bugs in scripts need to be fixed.  ",4
6351,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Deleted A,"Nov 18, 2018",This course seems to have been abandoned by Coursera. Mentors never reply to discussion forum posts (if there is any active mentor at all). Many assignments and tests are confusing and misleading. There are numerous materials you can find online to learn about Graphical Models than spending time & money on this.,1
6352,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,M,"Jan 6, 2018","Good course, with actual university level content and depth (albeit in a multiple choice format). The explanations of the material were clear, however if you don't have at least a surface level familiarity with Bayesian probability and first year university level math, you'll find yourself spending a lot of time looking up random jargon on Wikipedia. 
If you lack the necessary background, I suggest reviewing the content of Stanford CS109 (the content is publically available).
The assignments were a bit opaque / wordy; instead if an essay, provide clear bullet point tasks with a detailed appendix for clarity. Also, please use Python instead of Matlab. It's free, there's a more support available for it, it has much clearner syntax, much more comprehensive libraries and it's at least tollerably performant (in comparison to Matlab / Octave).",4
6353,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Michael S E,"Feb 15, 2017","This course was solid overall but not excellent.  I learned the basics of different classes of probabilistic models including Bayesian networks and Markov networks and how to represent them.  Prof. Koller is knowledgeable and presented the materially logically.  With that said, this course could have been a lot better than it was.
The honors programming assignments could have been excellent  The material was interesting and dovetailed well with the course content.  But the assessment process was very frustrating and led to a lot of wasted time debugging that was geared more to quirks of the grader than to course concepts.  Both test cases and feedback on failed submissions were woefully inadequate.  Some of the quizzes were also frustrating, featuring what I consider to be ""gotcha"" questions geared more to creating a grading curve than to measuring understanding of the material.
Advice to course staff: (1) Please provide more test cases on coding assignments (2) Please provide better feedback in submission reports (3) Please monitor the discussion boards more actively for unanswered questions (4) If you want to provide an externally linked executable you intend students to run from Matlab, it's not reasonable to give a 32 bit file in 2017 and send us down a rabbit hole where you suggest we build the executable from source, which in turn requires us to build the boost library from source.",3
6354,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Alex L,"Apr 10, 2018","This is not an easy course, so beware. The instruction is solid but you still need to reason through a lot on your own, and especially if you choose to complete the Honors programming section (which I highly recommend to prove to yourself that you really understand what you have learned and can apply it), you really need to plan on allocating sufficient number of hours to work through the programming assignments.  You'll likely need to re-watch several of the video segments several times for it to really sink in, as well as referencing the Discussion Forum when you are stuck and need inspiration.  Once you do complete this course (after many hours of work and thought) you will enjoy a deep sense of accomplishment, will look and think about decision-making in a fresh new way, and have learned many very useful skills.",5

My biggest piece of feedback is on the programming assignments.  These really should be in Python.  Octave is an okay choice, and I suspect might have to do with Andrew Ng original choice to use it for his own machine learning course. However, the data science community writ large uses Python and R, which is why Andrew switched to Python for his deep learning courses.

You need to analyse them regularly and I watched some lectures again few times. Since you need to extend a provided Matlab code, it is often required to debug and check how it works in details.

Especially for me as a non-native foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow. And now I am at one point in the course, that is ""Flow of Probalistic Influence"", where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions ""flow"" and ""influence"" which makes me difficult to understand what is going on.

The lack of engagement from the TA/Mentor community takes what could have been a 5 star experience and drops it to zero.  But I can't go that low, so 1 star it is. ",1
6396,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Roman F,"Mar 12, 2021","This course is poorly structured, the material is poorly explained, the lecturer is going too fast and does not stress important concepts, video, and sound quality are below average. Do not recommend.
The structure of this course is an example of how not to teach mathematics. Examples before definitions and introduction of general concepts, lack of direction and ""big picture"" context, unexcusable things like ""let's prove it by example""... It is very frustrating and almost impossible to follow.  ",1
6397,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Sumod K M,"May 6, 2019","The course contents and presentation is of very high quality. The assignments and quizzes are both challenging and very rewarding.  The only minor qualm is that the programming assignment grader seems to have few issues. For one, MATLAB indexing is really hard to work with. Secondly, it doesn't test the answers fully in some cases. Like the case of OptimizeWithJointUtility, OptimizeLinearExpectations. My codes passed the grader but I was splitting to hair to figure out why my answers to quiz questions corresponding to programming assignment were wrong. Turned out that my code was incorrect for the two programming assignments and that was causing issues. Otherwise, really nice course. Thank you :).",5
6398,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Ka L K,"Mar 27, 2017","A five stars course. Prof. Koller is an outstanding scientists in this field. The first part just introduce you two basic frames of graphical models. So go further into second part is necessary if you want to have a bigger picture. The whole course is an introduction to the book - Probabilistic Graphical Models of Prof. Koller, so buying her book is also highly recommended. This course is supposed to be hard, so you should expect a steep learning curve. But all the efforts you made are worthy. I suggest coursera will consider put more challenging exercises in order to extent the concentration. Finally, a highly respect to Prof. Koller who provide the course in such a theoretical depth. ",5
6399,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Marcelo B,"Nov 25, 2020","The course is very well organized and good leveled. The contents you get from the videos need to be completed/understood with the book. This makes this course a hard one, but very enjoyable. Having said that, I would suggest some improvements, if I am allowed. The first one is to update the course material to reflect the current scope of machine learning (e.g., Deep Learning). The second one is to include the option to code in Python. The last one is related to the final grade. I believe that giving the 24hs submission option is exaggerated. I really enjoyed the course and got a vision on PGM that will allow me to apply them in my work.",5
6400,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Sha L,"Apr 20, 2017","it's really hard course for me but after completing and see the certificate I feel so good about it. Yesterday someone asked a question regarding conditional independence. I remember before I took the course I've spent quite some time understanding it, just like him. But yesterday I didn't event think about it and gave him the right answer using ""active trail"" and ""D-separation"" concept. That's how powerful this course can be. 
I didn't work on the honor track though because I'm currently short of time. But I think I will come back and taking the other 2 courses in this series.",5
6401,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Blake B,"May 22, 2017","Awesome intro to graphical models, and the exercises really emphasize understanding and proceed at what seems like the appropriate pace. Challenging for sure, you need to want to learn this stuff. Only downside is I'm not a fan of using octave/matlab--really wish this could be rebuilt using python for all the exercises. I've probably spent 60% of my time devoted to this course on getting that setup working and wrestling with telling the computer to do what I want in an unpopular language--at least, unpopular out in the world outside of academia.

6402,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Chan-Se-Yeun,"Jan 7, 2018","This course is quite interesting not that easy. It helps me understand Markov network. The questions within the video are very helpful. It helps me check out some essential concepts and details. What's more, I'm fascinated by the teacher's voice and her teaching style, though detailed reading is required off class to gain comprehensive understanding. This is the first time I take online course in courser, and it's fun. I think I'll keep on learning the rest 2 courses of this series.",5
6403,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Haowen C,"Sep 2, 2017","Excellent course for picking out just the critical portions of the Koller & Friedman book (which is over 1000 pages long, forget about reading it cover to cover for self study). Don't skip the programming assignments, they're very important for solidifying your understanding. You'll spend at least 75% of the time fussing over the somewhat arbitrary and baroque data structures used to represent factors and CPDs in this course, but at the end it's worth the frustration.",5
6404,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Dawood A C,"Oct 26, 2016","The course was very fruitful. It is was not that easy of course, I think it is one of the most difficult courses on Coursera but it deserves to try it once, twice and as many as you can until you understand the idea behind the course. The exams and the honor assignments were so tricky and not that easy to solve.

6407,Probabilistic Graphical Models 1: Representation by Stanford University,Dimitrios K,"Nov 1, 2016",So happy to complete this one. It was tough - especially the programming exercises and mainly due to high degree of vague-ness and un-expressiveness of matlab/octave in contrast to e.g. Python or Scala. samiam was unexpectedly handy and usable.

It's clear that there are additional considerations in ML projects that aren't present in standard software product management. I would've like if they had provided some examples on how a deep learning project (like photo identification) might be different than a simpler model like regression from the product management perspective. The other improvement I think would've been more actual multiple-choice tests at the end of each chapter - the ""discussion"" tests are helpful to a degree for thinking through the information, but you don't get any feedback on them. I'd actually like something that tests whether or not I'm learning the material as well. But overall, for people who are genuinely dedicated to learning about ML projects, this was a helpful course.",4

This is the course that I was the more eager to take in the specialization as I have created Computer Vision models previously (and added that functionality to my iOS app) last year.
Things I specially liked:
- The week on Segmentation and particularly the assignment as I will be able to do similar implementation with other models like U-Net
- I like the weekly quiz to solidify the new knowledge.
Things I liked less:
- The assignment of Week 2 on Object Detection as it required too much getting in the customization of a specific model. That being said, the exercice is probably useful and training from only 5 images is cool...",5

6602,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Mark v d S,"Apr 6, 2019","This course is very good. Make sure you know very basic principals of R-programming, or just programming in general. It doesn't have to be much, but a little knowledge will spare a lot of frustration.
There are a few errors in the course and the quiz answers here and there, and the forum is not maintained well. Brace for week 3 and 4! The instructor speaks very fast and unclear for some people (especially non native speakers I guess), and the material gets quite tricky in these weeks. However, it all gets a bit easier again later. 
So much for my whining. The instructor(s) actually uses a lot of fun ways to dive into statistic methods. week 6 and 7 were an absolute blast to me. Finally, the course really teaches you a lot about basic statistics! So it does exactly what it is meant to do.
p.s. Don't stress for your final exam. You get more attempts per month than it says. Take a few hours for it though. ",4

Pros
Comprehensive
Great illustrations
Cons
Requirement time is grossly underestimated in the course overview
Quiz questions can be stated in a confusing manner
Videos can cover topics too fast without enough examples or information",3
6605,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Deleted A,"Apr 2, 2019","The course is good so far...However be warned that you need to know the basics of a computing language called R.

Exams are good and the feedback provided references the lecture in question, so that you can re-watch it, very nice. 
The biggest drawback of this course are the R labs. The questions are extremely sloppy, full of spelling errors. Most of the questions could have been asked during the regular exam, since all you are doing is submitting answers, no programming needed at all. If there are multiple questions in one section, there is no way of knowing which one you got wrong, it will simply say ""something isn't right"", which is very infuriating. 
I hope they will shift these questions from the R lab to the regular exam. Given that I'm paying a considerable monthly fee to take this course, I would have definitely expected this aspect to be better, and feedback to be taken seriously, which I don't think it is unfortunately.",3

6609,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Sara O,"Jul 7, 2020","This course is quite poorly organized. The primary reason why I took this course was because I wanted to learn basic statistics without using python or R. Unfortunately for those of us who just wanted to learn statistics, this course requires you to learn R, which is something that should be made clear to people before they purchase. 
As for the rest of the course, the first two weeks are done well. While the concepts are presented quickly, those two weeks have the benefit of having a ""summary"" video at the end in which all of the concepts are brought together using an example. 
Starting in week 3, a different instructor presents the material. His primary goal seems to try and speak as quickly as possible without explaining much of anything.  In fact, he will sometimes slur or stumble slightly over words due to this. The slides used in the videos are also riddled with errors., as pointed out by people in the discussion forums. Despite all of this, week 3 was still manageable because the material presented is very simple. As you progress through the course, though, and as the material becomes more complicated, I felt like I was just plugging numbers into formulas without really understanding what I was doing or the concepts behind those formulas.
All in all, save your money and go to stattrek or another site if you actually want to learn statistics. ",1
6610,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Kanglu Y,"Feb 7, 2016","I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear. 
But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistic. Or first Basic Statistic than R.

Although the whole team spend a lot of time preparing the course and try to make the course vivid, as a student with minimal statistic knowledge it is still really important for me to understand each concept and equations instead of just reciting them. For every equations that appeared in this course I was asking why, but there is no explanation of why this equation is like this and how you derive, there are just follow up examples to put the number in the equation and calculate them.

The course has not provided learners with sufficient materials, such as standard z-table, t-table, etc. Several concepts are not thoroughly explained (the P-value, for example), perhaps due to their toughness, so good articles with elaborate explanation on these concepts would be a great addition.

I do have some background in this subject due to a previous masters degree, as well as work experience, but this course was an extremely helpful refresher of the basic concepts that one needs to know. What I liked most about this course was the crisp explanations provided in the instructional videos; without taking too much time in delivering the required message. I also liked the fact that the quizzes focused more on testing the understanding of the concept rather than expecting me to perform complicated multi-page calculations. Would recommend this as a very useful starting point for others like me. It would be helpful if some kind of a diagnostic exam was added at the start of the course so that students of different backgrounds could assess if they're ready for the course or not.",5

I've learned so much in this course (and in the other courses of this specialization) and this knowledge will be really useful when I start my research masters next fall.

I thought the weakest sections were the ones taught by Prof. Emiel van Loon (the dark-haired one). I found him much less clear and engaging than Prof. Matthijs Roduijn (the blonde one). The R labs were fine for me because I have a background in programming, but people without that may need a lot of time to do them. ",4

Matthijs Rooduijn explained his classes pretty clear and I understood a lot more thanks to him. Emiel van Loon tried to explained the two modules of probabilities, and in my opinion it´s really hard to follow his explanations, you need a lot of patience for his two weeks.
In general, the course is pretty nice. I like the R lab exercises in DataCamp and you can check your mistakes on all quices and try them once again, what allows you to learn well.
I give 3 stars because, besides all the good stuff, the course has some mistakes on different exercises (in both quices and R labs). And the course doesn´t have mentors right now, or anyone to whom you can scream if you don´t undestand something. My personal recommendation is to do this course with someone else if you aren´t autodidactic, and have a lot of patience when a exercise is marked as wrong.",3

The quality of the videos is good, and the lecturers do a good job of explaining the concepts in a clear and concise manner.
I invested easily twice (if not more) the stated weekly study time in order to internalize the concepts being presented in the course, and I would highly recommend others do the same if they want to get the most out of the course.
The only thing I missed were perhaps further practice exercises with solutions, beyond those covered in the lecture or practicals. That would be the only neutral point in an otherwise very good course!",5

As long as you focus, and dedicate time to properly pay attention, write notes, give their examples a go before continuing the video, and to learn where you went wrong, you will find this course very useful! Though some videos seem like they could be more concise, their explanations and examples have allowed me to vividly picture the different concepts, and remember them!

6648,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Bill G,"Mar 2, 2019","Thanks for a great course. I really learned a lot. I came away with what I wanted: a basic grasp of key concepts in statistics that previously I had merely a superficial understanding of -- standard deviation, confidence interval, Pearson's r, etc. The video lectures were fantastic: clear, engaging, fun. I liked that I could pause them when I was confused on a point. A couple of criticisms, though. First, I found the r program frustrating at times. Sometimes it was used in a way that helped me to better understand the course's key ideas. But too often it was an exercise in guessing the obscure programing code to use. Since I'm unlikely to ever use the program again (and I suspect this is true of most students), overall I found the r programming of limited value. The other drawback of the course -- not your fault! -- was the same problem with all on-line courses. At times, I just wanted to ask a question or get a clarification on a point, but that just wan't an option. Finally, I think it would have been helpful had you provided an in-depth explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer for each question on the quizzes. For the quizzes, I was usually able to figure out the right answer (eventually), but not so for the final, which didn't provide any explanation as to why I got certain questions wrong. But, as I said, overall this was very good course. I got my money's worth.",4

The assignments and the R exercises are well designed and align perfectly with the course content which helps as well. 
Meanwhile I wish there was more explanation about the math behind the formulas (as to how those formulas were derived) instead of just teaching us how to put numbers into those formulas. That way we'd be able to better understand the ""why"" behind the fascinating data behaviors. For instance why do we say when n >= 30 then the sampling distribution of sample mean is normally distributed? Why when number of success >= 15 and number of failures >=15 then the sampling distribution of sample proportion is normally distributed?  What are the actual reasons behind using t-table instead of z-table when we do not know the population σ?  Just a couple examples off the top of my head. ",4

-the R labs are a good idea, but in practice become somewhat of a waste of time, and I do not feel as though I have really learned any practical R
-starting week 3, there are several errors on the screen that still have not been updated (I'm taking this course in 2021)--this leads to a lot of frustration as you often struggle to figure out why the numbers on the screen are what they are, and then have to check the discussion forums for clarity. Also, at the end of week 3, the lessons start moving very quickly, and are compounded by these errors, which makes it extremely difficult to conceptualize what is being taught.

I am not getting much out of this and tired of rewatching videos 5 or 6 times hoping to understand or memorize something. There is probably better use of my time. I will try Duke's version now. 
How to improve this? Put some questions after each video. Waiting till the end to give the students some questions which causes them to go back and replay all those 'super fast' videos again - Feels a bit lazy as way to teach. Maybe its me.
Can someone on Coursera just simply teach stats without trying to tie in a programming language? Since its obvious by now, you guys can't teach both well in one course how about just focusing on one well? (I'm looking at you Stats w/ Python Univ of Michigan). ",1

I was amazed by the production quality of the videos. The team really worked hard to make the course interesting. This course really is an example of what online courses are supposed to be!
Some complaints that could also be my fault or just my preference:
(1) I had some problems at the last test. I did not pass the first time. I looked up the videos to the problems that I failed. I thought I had applied the correct formulars and the video supported my approach to the problem, but it was still wrong in the test. I still do not know whether I misunderstood or if they made a mistake.
(2) I do not like that they enforce rounding to 2 decimals in many exercises. I was stuck several times because I stored the value in a variable instead of rounding it before submitting the answer.

I am thankful to the Commonwealth of Learning team as well as the Coursera team, for the opportunity to complete this course.",5
6679,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Jacob S,"Jun 18, 2016","Really a great introductory course. I am a real beginner in statistics, since I need it to make it easier for my self at data mining and machine learning in the future, this course gives me a solid basic understanding of terminology, calculations and relationships between calculations. Week 3 and 4 are pretty hard in my opinion, but after doing the course learning how to learn I know how to handle it, so I will recommend everybody to do that one also if you think this looks too difficult for you.

6680,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Aurangazeeb A K,"Jan 6, 2019","One of the best courses on Coursera and I'm saying this with an experience of 10+ courses on Coursera. The teaching strategy is brand new, with some surprises from the awesome teachers ! Statistics now feels like child's-play. Thank you University of Amsterdam for making this amazing course.

One more thing, be ready for a surprise at the first video of week 6.",5
6681,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Elena K,"Sep 30, 2016","A really great course. Simple to follow and understand, but provides insights into the basics of statistics. Almost no math which is good news for non-experts and makes the course more accessible for a broader audience. The lecturers explain the intuition behind the fundamental things in statistics, which I find very important before studying the statistical tests (inferential statistics). Feels like it opened my eyes. 
Thank you very much Matthijs Rooduijn and Emiel van Loon!",5
6682,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Leitha M,"Feb 27, 2016","I've always had a rough time with mathematics, but the way this course is structured makes it easy for me to go at my own pace, re-watch videos that were confusing the first time through and work through problems until I really felt like I understand how the formulas work. The consistent use of exercises in R were extremely useful as well. I'd highly recommend this course and learning system for people like me, who never thought they'd be able to grasp mathematics. ",5
6683,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Giulia L,"May 13, 2020","I decided to start that course as I am not good at statistic, but I wanted to learn more about it and see if I was wrong.

Great job!",5
6687,Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam,Eric M E,"Mar 23, 2016","Simple explanations that make the topic rather easy to learn and having a visual aid (the drawings) I find it to be so much more friendly that I've really come to enjoy what I'm learning (I'm mostly a visual learner so to me this is very good).

6785,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Annie L,"Feb 28, 2020","It was awful. The whole course was poorly structured or at least I couldn't understand the logic between the lessons.
Watching the videos was truly painful: I don't understand the virtues of watching someone type with all the typing noise, the countless mistakes and few proper explanation. We should have had access to slides, with the code on one side and comments on the other, such as in the previous course.
It is a unfortunate we have no access to the code in a format that could be copy-pasted neither in the instructions nor in the solutions. 
On the whole, I don't really understand how  such a course can be put online without more serious proof testing. Some of the instructions were out of date (using databases that were not provided) or sometimes the solutions gave results different from what we would get typing the exact same code. These problems are long reported by other learners on the forum, without being corrected.
And the final test? I found the instructions very poor: we had to do two graphs without being told what question they should answer. If I did right, these graphs did not add anything to the solution compared to a simple table. The whole test was just a replication of something seen the last week of the course ;  what we were told the previous weeks was of no use at all in there. And the 'solution' does not provides the numbers needed to properly grade the works. Has no one re-read it?",1
6786,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Anisha Z,"Apr 4, 2020","I was quite disappointed with this course
1) They don't teach advanced SQL concepts adequately well (For example Windowing functions/Pivoting). I recommend self-learning from https://mode.com/sql-tutorial
 2) Almost all of the content in the first 3 weeks was useless. Going through https://mode.com/sql-tutorial practice problems helped me learn the concepts better
3) The final assignment solution didn't match any of the the solutions I reviewed. I think the dataset has been altered, so it's impossible to get answers that match the final assignment 
4) In the statistics refresher the instructor makes completely incorrect statements. For example, she says if two confidence intervals overlap then the differences are not significant. This is incorrect!
I did this so that I get the specialization certificate, but wouldn't recommend this course as a stand-alone",1
6787,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Susan L,"Nov 8, 2019","I liked the content of this course. It is very practical. The teaching style was frustrating for me, though. I understand that the instructor wanted us to ""see"" that everyone, even experts, make silly mistakes when they code (like forget ,'s or the mis-name variables), but watching mistakes being made in EVERY solutions video was too much. More time should have been taken explaining the coding concepts, rather than watching mistakes. 
Also, there wasn't much discussion. I had trouble with some of the early assignments and (as instructed) asked for help in the discussion. But no one EVER responded! So I stopped asking for help. Basically, everyone just wrote ""done"" or something like that. To be fair, I'm not sure anyone actually looked at or read the discussion threads. You just had to write something in the discussion box to unlock the solutions video. 
There also seemed to be some errors in the solution codes. Some of the solutions were fine, but others spawned errors when I cut and pasted them into Mode (the software we used). I still don't understand in one of the final assignments how the instructor used the table dsv1069.events_big (or something like that that wasn't listed as one of the files we had access to). When I tried using this file in my own code, I got an error. When I cut and pasted the entire solution code, I got an error. Maybe I was doing something wrong. I just don't know.

6793,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Jamison C,"Oct 22, 2020","Full disclosure upfront: I did not finish this course.
Benefits: Learning about Mode as an online platform for practicing SQL with a variety of practice databases.  The use cases seem potentially useful and provide some meaning and purpose to exercises.  I would instead recommend you visit Mode.com independently and simply save money and time by not taking this course.
Criticisms: I teach R for data science and have designed several tutorials and graduate-level courses.  This involves deliberate exercises in empathy to understand where a student may begin, what resources she or he may need, varying levels of granularity in lectures, and a logical order in which to learn new material. 
This course seems entirely bereft of an pedagogical rigor, by any definition.  It is a salad of awkwardly narrated screen casts and the occasional slide, along with bumbling walkthroughs of solutions (some of which failed).  I had to stop the course as the content literally made me uncomfortable.  
As an instructor, I'm never this harsh in providing feedback either to students or fellow instructors, but as a customer, it would be unethical to stay silent.  Avoid the dreadfulness and seek another course.  UC Davis' brand is taking a hit with this course.",1
6794,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Adam A,"Sep 28, 2020","There is a large jump in difficulty between this and the previous course in the series, 'SQL for Data Science'. The instructor/course description don't mention that you'll be using PostgreSQL (after exclusively using Sqlite in the previous course). And an ER Diagram is not provided for you, nor even a list of Tables in the database (hosted on mode.com).
Additionally, the format of this course is such that almost no actual Instruction is offered. The majority of the work is expected to be done by students independently via worksheets in the form of PDFs with screenshots of starting code (query text cannot be copy/pasted). The only Instructor led activities in Week 1 are short videos covering the Solutions to previous worksheets.
If you already have experience with PostgreSQL you may be okay, but I much prefer having more Lecture content prior to attempting large assignments. It would also be nice of the Instructor or a Course Admin were more active in the Discussion Forum so students could get feedback.
Overall I don't think this course is worth the money.",1

So I left a  meaningless comment in my submission just to unlock the solution video  so I can then begin learning.  
Overall I didn't feel like there  was enough context built into the solution videos to explain the process  such as why certain functions, joins, etc. where used and a summary of  the overall path of the solution video was absent but could have been  very helpful as there is a lot covered in each video.

The content is interesting, relevant and well explained- however, if you need a hint with the assignments there is no help at all. I have been waiting two weeks now for my assignment to be graded (having to pay another month of coursera while I wait...) and no one has reviewed it yet. It is all peer reviewed which meant that when I submitted an assignment that I had found difficult, I am still no more informed as to what I did well and what I got wrong and therefore learnt very little from it. Assignment questions are confusingly phrased and I spent two days trying to complete it before another student wrote on the message board an explanation of what was actually being asked that many people had been trying to find out. At one point I had to submit my assignment knowing it was probably incorrect and that I simply did not understand what was being asked- a query which could have been explained in twenty seconds by the instructor but instead I had to submit, fail the assignment (not surprisingly) and then try again with another guess at the requirement.

I wished they took more time to think out this course before making the videos. 
Also, and perhaps even more importantly, the final assignment which is done through the MODE app, does not allow you to create a link to share your work publically. You must have the BUSINESS version to share externally. On top of that, you can't even quickly get a free trial in order to share the link. MODE wants to schedule an appointment to discuss a trial before they give you access to a trial version of an upgraded version. Why would this course require a paid version of a service to do the final assignment? That seems unacceptable to not state upfront.

Even on the final peer-reviewed assignment, the test asked us to query just a few specific metrics but then the grading rubric contained several other columns that weren't mentioned in the instructions.  It could have just said, ""And any other relevant metrics you can think of,"" or something, and that would've been a cue to come up with some of the additional columns, but that's not what it asked for.

I felt she must have a great knowledge about Ab testing and SQL but unable to pass the same to her students. I faced difficulty in understanding her situation, examples and more importantly how she write queries. There is no explanation on how and where the query comes from. She states clearly that if you don't understand please review the previous course or lessons. There are many stuffs in Course 2 which were not taught or shown in Course 1 to refer from. All above, using Mode analytics was not that user-friendly specially while submitting the final assignment. There are not clear indication or guidance how to use where to go etc. If we need to do self learning we could have gone directly to mode and grasp the knowledge.

The real-world application to preface each lesson was really good, but the quality of the instruction (more presenting information than actual instruction) and the follow up assignments weren't up to par: Frequently the lessons didn't provide enough information needed to do the assignments, and you'd only discover that when watching the follow up videos (quite frustrating). One of the solution videos in particular answered the questions out of order, which was quite confusing (how was that not caught before publishing?!). Several of the lessons felt a quite rushed - perhaps the slides could have included SQL snippets with bullet points and when to use each (like in the first course), in addition to watching the instructor construct the query. Often the assignment questions were ambigious - it wasn't clear what an end result should look like... an example of a finished query and maybe a hint or two about what would needed could have alleviated this.

6838,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Mercedes T,"Mar 22, 2022","This course uses Postgres - it is never once mentioned. It is also completely unnecessary to download any editor as all your ""work"" is done on Mode (external website).
There is a HUGE gap in knowledge between the first course and this second course in this series. The topics mentioned that we should know or go back to the first course were not even in the first course, and if I'm going to be constantly going to videos online on free sites, then what was the point in paying for this course? It also became painfully clear that it's expected that we have some deep understanding of the data and business, and since we (the students) did not create this data and don't have any real maps of how things are connected or what they acutally represent, it makes this course that much more aggrevating. I'm still not even sure what the ""AB Testing"" portion of this class was aside from the instructor talking about a few examples in her videos. Possibly there was AB testing in an assignment, but it was never once made clear that is what we were doing.
There is absolutely no actual instruction going on in this class. It's very frustrating and is structured as following: 
 a ""lecture"" (the instructor talking about something kinda of related to what you might be doing), 
an assignment that is more along the lines of ""figure it out,"" 
an ""optional"" discussion (that isn't actually optional as it unlocks the solution), 
and a ""solutions"" video where the instructor walks you through her thought process of the assignment that you just had to figure out. More often than not, the assignment you do does not match up to what is in the video. Also, a lot of the data isn't the same, and it's just beyond frustrating.
By week 4, I was very much done and didn't care anymore.
I have no doubt that the instructor is very good at her profession (she mentions being a data analyst at Scribd), but she is not a teacher/instructor by any means. This whole course is more of us just following  along as she does her solutions on video.",1
6839,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Jing Z,"Mar 18, 2023","I regret to say that this course did not meet my expectations. As a learner seeking to acquire skills in SQL for data analysis purposes, I found the course to be lacking in several aspects that I consider essential to effective learning.
Firstly, the instructor's approach to teaching was less than satisfactory. Rather than explaining concepts and demonstrating their applications, she simply showed what she did, leaving me without a clear understanding of the underlying principles. Consequently, I did not gain much from the course and was left feeling disappointed.
Secondly, the quality of the teaching videos was unsatisfactory. The instructor made numerous mistakes, and the videos were unedited, resulting in lengthy videos that took up valuable learning time. I believe that this shows a lack of professionalism on the part of the instructor.
Thirdly, the instructions for the assignments were unclear, causing confusion among students. Often, it was unclear what was expected in a question, leading to frustration and time wastage.
Fourthly, the course structure lacked organization, with no apparent connection between different chapters. This made it challenging to follow the course and understand how the topics fit together.
Finally, I was disappointed by the instructor's lack of responsiveness to student queries. After asking a question in the Q&A section, I received no response for two months, leaving me feeling unsupported in my learning journey.
While the course covers a wide range of A/B testing aspects, the instructor's inability to teach effectively undermined this advantage.
In conclusion, I would not recommend this course to fellow learners seeking to gain SQL skills for data analysis purposes. Coursera has many other courses and instructors that offer more effective teaching and learning experiences.",1

Sorry to say this but this because i firmly believe the instructor is a very nice and intelligent person but the course felt like a waste of time to me. I only finished it for the specialization.
The first two to three weeks were mostly irrelevant to the final project. And the module about AB testing felt taken out of context with no proper explanation how a test is set up etc. Even I as an experienced regression analysist felt very confused by her ""explanations""
I felt lost during the exercises. The gap between the first course and this course is tremendous. Also, the instructor does not explain anything, rather she expects you to know everything in before or to google your problems.  She does provide a solution but its hard to follow why she is doing what she is doing and more than 50% of the videos is her checking on her own mistakes. Furthermore codes during exercises are screenshots not actual lines of code which means you have to copy every starter code by hand which takes a lot of time in the later exercises....I feel sorry to say that because she really does seem a kind and nice person and I believe she has deep knowledge about the topic but the way of ""try it for yourself and then I'll show you"" is not what i expect from a PAID course. What is the point of paying for a course when I have to refer to external information, get unclear instructions such as ""Look at the table and tell me about it""....

6857,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Spyridon M,"Jun 16, 2023"," Unfortunately, this course looked more like a university course and not at all like an online course. There were many theoretical elements not covered, with strong emphasis towards subjects of little interest (at least to me). For example, in the AB testing section, there very little theory and interminable exercises over tables that have not been sufficiently explained before. Also, terminology was used without having been explained before (the term 'lift' in the final test for example has not been mentioned before). 
Another feature I did not appreciate throughout this course was the need to remember the features of a dataset and the contents of the tables without a star schema or other resource. This made the exercises a bit pointless in the sense that for people that cannot go through the course continuously, they had to re-familiarize themselves with the contents of different tables before any new session. For me personally, this defies the entire scope of doing an online course.
The final test also demanded things that were not demonstrated throughout the course (how does one use the report builder to write text?) and no code was assessed (what was the test about then? only AB testing???).
So, bottom line, the only section in this course that was really useful for me was where the instructions on how to construct a complex query were displayed. I certainly hope the next course in this specialization is more interesting and informative.

6858,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Fabian E P C,"Aug 25, 2022","Hello,
The course contains good information and an approach to the use of SQL that is not very common, as it does not focus on the uses that are traditionally used for teaching, it is very different to work with data as seen. However, the structure of it, the activities and the way it is explained leaves much to be desired, it is not clear on the tasks, the 'teaching' videos are very vague on the concepts and the flow of the videos is not very dynamic. 
I understand that the day to day work of a data scientist is not all roses, but in a course you should be a bit more specific in the assignments and teachings. 
I would not recommend this specialization for someone who is just starting with SQL, the two courses I have taken so far I do not consider appropriate for a beginner, the first one for being a mere review in slides and this one for what I have already mentioned. 
I am sure Kat is a very good data scientist, but she needs to improve her skills as a teacher and she needs a team to support her, you can see that the courses were created at the first time, without a general supervision and in a very short time.

Pros
+teaches you how to adapt to poor instructions, maybe
Cons
-You are navigating a relational database with no relational database and no schema, so hope you enjoy watching the poorly edited and long video given as your sole explanation.
-requires a knowledge of statistics which is not stated until the end
-requires you to graph without teaching you how
-poorly created questions, questions will be vague and often with poor grammar and incomplete sentences such as ""Is this the right way this join. "" Further, these questions might have unrelated sub questions that aren't revealed until you see the solutions such as asking whether or not an executable query looks correct with no context given on the question itself, only to discover that the query isn't good because it doesn't accomplish some yet unstated goal. 
-you have to use mode analytics using instructions that, if I'm not mistaken, are outdated and no longer apply, so from week 1 you'll find yourself jerry rigging whatever you need and hoping its correct which
-once again if I'm not mistaken, the data in the database is updated? Thus changing the data and answers,  meaning you can't know if your queries are correct without first knowing how to do the query as the solutions won't match, rendering the course redundant.
-the final project contains no instructions on how to share it, so you have to hope the peer grader can see it, which at this moment, I'm not actually sure how to share it correctly, and there are several people also struggling to share their report in the discussion forum
-the course doesn't actually teach you how to do its queries, and the course beforehand does not teach you how, such as using PARTITION OVER
-the SQL in the PDFs that you are supposed to complete, are for some ungodly reason, screenshots. Meaning you have to hand type the entire thing with no errors (which can lead to a lot of painful consequences for people who aren't SQL experts, such as the people taking this course).",1
6872,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Justin M,"Jan 16, 2021","This course did deal with some useful ideas; things like research design, statistical testing, and what to do with data that isn't cleanly structured. A lot of times, it was like the instructor was taking a normal day on a data science job and walking you through it.
The issue is the lack of structure to the course. Because it was like a a day on a job, there weren't explicit learning goals. Things like ""Today we're going to learn how to clean messy data"" isn't a learning goal. Instead, you want something like ""Here are some ways in which data are messy. I'll walk you through what I do with each one."" 
The assignments reflect this. I can't stress enough how poorly the assignments supported my learning. The assignments were usually very vague, with instructions that I had to parse through to understand what was even required of me. Questions that just asked open-ended ""Does this look right?"" kind of questions? I mean... looks fine to me, but I'm literally in a beginner SQL course so what do I know? Then we watch a solutions video where the instructor writes the code to answer it. It lacks any kind of student engagement and doesn't facilitate learning at all.
It's really indicative of the lack of structure of the course. Since there aren't learning goals, there isn't any framework from which to design assignments. The information lacks context, so it doesn't seem useful until the very final assignment, when you need to have learned the A/B testing stuff (but not really anything else). The course material doesn't build together in a logical fashion. I feel like you could take the 4 modules in any order and you'd get the same out of it. This suggests that there isn't a core skill that's being developed over time, but rather a mishmash of ideas that might be useful in a data science position. 
In all, I can't recommend this course. The instructor is an excellent data scientist, I'm sure. But her teaching could use some work. ",1
6873,"Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL by University of California, Davis",Joseph C,"Dec 21, 2020","Very poor course. The information was very hard to interpret as the videos provided in the course did not give live output of the query being used or highlight the important sections that were being described. Additionally, the actions requested in the quizzes were incredibly vague and did not prompt the learner for what was actually being asked. This made it nigh impossible to complete the course as it was set up to accomplish. It did not ever even explicitly state which SQL language was being used (note it is different from the language used in the first course in the series). Finally, the crux of course was to teach AB Testing with SQL, however, it was explained in a fashion that was not clear or concise and did not demonstrate a real world sense of how it could be implemented in a work environment, how to set up an experiment, or even how it was accomplishing the task through SQL. 
Hopefully it will make more sense as I go over the course from the beginning, but please be aware that this course was not well constructed and any insight that you might glean from it will require much more research on your part.

However, the way it is taught is poor. The content is disorganized and not explained well, leaving you to have to do separate research. I'm not one to bash students needing to do their own research, however this class offers no guidance. The first course of this specialization was great, and I've heard great things of all of the courses that follow this one. However this course is a miss.
The concepts are good but the execution is terrible. Not enough time was spent on the lectures, the examples that are worked through aren't taught properly, you're just watching the instructor do the assignment with very little good explanation. 
Personally, I'd recommend this course be reworked to be more descriptive in each section. An extra 2 weeks to allow the instructor to take her time teaching the concepts is a very good idea. The homework/assignments also need to have their instructions rewritten to be more clear.",1

The videos did not prepare well for the practice exercises, the exercise sheets and solution videos seemed to have been set up quick and dirty and the quizzes were full of mistakes and misleading questions. 

But the setup and material was not the only problem. One of the main goals of the course was to show and get used to common problems you encounter when working with a new dataset. To reach this goal, an arbitrary dataset has been introduced and investigated in depth. Fair enough, but I do not think, that it is necessairy to do such an in depth investigation just to raise awareness that datasets might be messy and the use and distribution of such data must be done carefully. The methods themself will in most cases crucially depend on the dataset on the table and therefore will not generalize really well.

I learned many things from you. Please don't see it as arrogance but; As a data analyst, I now see myself at a higher level in SQL. I can even say that I am at the advanced SQL level according to mode.com. Thanks to you, my data analysis mind map with SQL has been shaped much more clearly. This is a great feeling for me. I think it would be much better if we could only do 1-2 different sample studies like the A/B test Final Exam. I am grateful to you ( COURSERA and UCDAVIS ) for giving me this opportunity.
But in addition I have to say;
Throughout the course, I encountered numerous challenges and struggled considerably. The exercises provided were often vague and lacked clarity, making it difficult to understand the intended objectives.   The overall experience of completing this course was excessively stressful. I believe that this course requires a some overhaul. It is also worth mentioning that while the first course utilized SQLite, the sudden transition to PostgreSQL.",5

I saw  some folks registered concern about some topics not clear, some topics addressed without introduction in the earlier course (e.g., windows).  Frankly, this kind of learning is what I am used to, walking into a real class on a university campus.  I am expected to dig in on my own where I don't quite get it.  The advantage here is that I can just keep replaying the video, until I finally grasp the concepts completely.  It took me twice to pass the final assignment.  On the first round I was graded by two fellow students; one guy had no mercy, and the other one was reasonable, but the combination resulted in a score less than 80%.  First time failure for me.  But I went back and reworked the assignment and developed a much more firm understanding of the concepts and skills.  Key point is that I am confident that I can use the skills practically and successfully in my work.  Thanks!",5

Pros:
1. Very good example code (jupyter notebooks) given. Can even be studied stanalone. Can be used as a reference for future cases.
2. Provides an holistic view in the regression pipeline.

Cons:
1. The course is outdated and not very professional and this is obvious in various examples, to name a few:
a) There are some syntax errors in the notebooks.
b) There are English grammatical/syntax errors.
c) There is content in the notebooks that was never introduced in the videos (SGD).
d) There are video duplicates with different naming.
e) The provided notebooks (normally 2 notebooks) each week are sometimes provided is wrong chronological order.
2. The course lacks mathematical foundation. In order to fully understand the topic you need to read theory from other resources in parallel.

7013,Data Visualization with Advanced Excel by PwC,Caitlyn,"Sep 27, 2019","First of, PowerPivot is not available on Mac which was not made known from the start of the course. If this course is going to use PowerPivot (a feature unavailable on Mac), it should have been stated the pre-requisites. 
Unresponsive instructors - students are troubleshooting and speaking amongst ourselves. Many threads are left without any replies at all, most were common issues. Some threads are as old as 3 years ago and still without replies from the instructors. I understand there is a lot of thread to go through but it is an expectation that tutors reply to most (if not, all) threads similar to course expectations on other platforms like Udemy. 
The course content sequence is illogical - Why is the student workbook section comes before the video section explaining the instructor's exercises? If that is the plan then you should have included instructions telling students to watch the rest of the videos before attempting the exercise. 
Also, answer sheet errors and incorrect answers should be rectified ASAP because it is very misleading for students (especially those newer to the subject matter) to understand whether they are getting the correct answer or not i.e. Week 1 Pivot 3b. There is a thread about this issue from 3 YEARS AGO and the answer sheet is still not revised. ",2
7014,Data Visualization with Advanced Excel by PwC,Jon G,"Jan 29, 2021","Good information, but the assignments included as part of the course are fraught with error. This is not just limited to things being incorrectly named (i.e. the example video nomenclature was copy pasted into the assignment, which did not make sense in relation to the question the assignment was asking), but also answer sheets were wrong. This is not a function of my skill level in excel, I use it regularly for work and previously knew most of the functions referenced in this course, numbers and information was straight up incorrect. Someone clearly spent very little time or thought building out many of these assignments, which is a shame, it could have been much better. It made it difficult to actually apply what I was doing in the videos, and I can't imagine how frustrating it would be for someone fairly new to excel and data analysis. ",2

The submissions should have been reviewed by professors and there should have been a SLA for review like 2 days, 3 days etc. This otherwise seems like a open ended program, depending on the whims and mercy of other candidates!",1
7197,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Sari S,"Jan 23, 2020","I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all the professors, instructors and staffs who had put such great effort in putting together this extensive Specialization.
I enjoyed all the contents in this Specialization.
However, much as I enjoyed working on the Capstone project, I have to say I found the peer review system to be degrading the overall quality of the course and the Specialization.
With peer reviews, you can't guarantee a reasonable and valid evaluation.
Firstly, you can't get any meaningful feedback.
I found most peers did such quick jobs with the evaluation that out of 12 feedbacks I received throughout the course, there was just one comment that was thought-provoking to some extent. All the rest were something like ""Good job"" and ""I like it"", with something as meaningless as ""N/A"".
Secondly, the quality and the validity of the evaluation is in question.
As I was evaluating other peer students' works, I came to think some students didn't quite understand the essence of the assignment.  You are asked to propose a strategy for action to solve the problem of ad-blockers. Many of the works I reviewed didn't have sufficient actions to solve it, though.  For example, some proposed to do descriptive analytics.  Doing descriptive analytics alone doesn't solve anything, let alone the ad-blocking problem.
The problem here, though, is not that some students are not understanding the essence of business analytics and the assignment associated with it.  It's the fact that those students are evaluating others' works.  I do not see how such students can provide anyone with valid evaluation.
In the Forum, I came across a comment from few years back pointing out something similar.  The course instructor answered to that comment, saying students are eligible to review others' works because they completed the series of courses, and thus have the required knowledge.
There is a significant difference between figuring out the answers to multiple-choice questions to complete the courses and actually understanding the essence of the business analytics. This is now obvious because I had to give low points to some of peer students.
Lastly, the peer review system made the Forum meaningless as well.  The Forum was filled with comments begging for reviews, and it made it almost impossible to find any meaningful discussion about the project.  I think even the instructors gave up on going through the forum to find discussion threads they actually needed to pay attention to.  I asked a simple question about the project description, but no instructor bothered to answer.  I can understand why it occurred, because my question got buried under a pile of review requests soon after I posted it.
I took this Specialization with an expectation that I learn from the best.  I hope you revisit the course structure so that the Capstone project, which has a potential of being a great learning experience, would actually be worthy of being a part of this Wharton Specialization.",1
7198,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Robert B,"May 11, 2016","From my perspective, the individual courses that made up the ""Capstone"" (people, customer, accounting, and operations analytics) were both educative and interactive. These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.  
 However, the final ""Capstone"" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about. After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan. The entire ""Capstone"" was driven by hypotheticals, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses. An educated individual could easily complete this ""Capstone"", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses. The ""Capstone"" provided a few articles and videos related to the issue (Yahoo Ad Blocker) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content. I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the Ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business. However, the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions. This ""Capstone"" hardly related to the previous four courses, and it is a scam that this course cost $99.",1
7199,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Cheng Y Y J,"Jul 23, 2020","A bit frustrated with the peer review mechanism since one of my peer rated me zero points claiming that he/she sees that I've only completed the application exercise on my submission. However, I think he/she might have overlooked since the other 2 peers have rated me highly. Also, I appreciate that students have to submit their own assignment before reviewing peers, I believe this is to reduce chance of plagiarism. Unfortunately, since the portal allow re-submission, there's a short window where students can submit a ""fake"" assignment, then review & copy peers' assignment and re-submit. I got to review a peer's ""work"" that is EXACTLY the same with my own work. A review in scoring mechanism might be needed. Otherwise, the course is a good summary and application exercise of previous modules. ",4
7200,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Andre S,"Nov 22, 2018",I think may be a little bit more description about what are the requirements are needed to enroll in courses as customer analytics which the learners should have a good statistics skills. ,4
7201,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Raman K,"Apr 20, 2017","The course provides a case. We have to identify the problem. I appreciated the fact that how I define a problem decides on how I propose to address it. A different definition leads to altogether different steps! The course also provides a good template and sufficient guidelines to help us develop a strategy to address the problem we have defined. Finally , we have to think about how we can test if our strategy is viable. We are also guided to think about the changes that might be necessary in our organization in terms of structure, KPIs, skills etc. Given the nature of this capstone project one cannot expect it to be too specific and have a heavy application of analytics. What it does is provide you with a good idea of how to put all that you have learned in each of the specializations in a comprenesive manner, and that how these ideas fit together to create a big picture. If you are looking at complex  number crunching excerices then you will not find it here. If you are looking for excerices that will make you think and think and think then you will be quite satisfied. I am!",5
7202,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Amanda A,"Aug 4, 2021","I am utterly furious about how much plagiarism I encountered in this course. While I personally found doing the activities helpful, the peer review that is used to determine 100% of your grade is not helpful. I experienced a situation in which someone I reported for plagiarism (had literally downloaded someone else's entire project and not bothered to edit their name off of it when submitting) went on to grade TWO of my assignments, and consistently graded me a full point to two points lower than everyone else per question. This included on questions that were not open to interpretation, such as ""were all of the application activities answered?"" Yes, they most certainly were. Did they deduct points? You bet. At best, this is allowing somebody who has no basis to grade things as a peer to determine outcomes for others; at worst, this reads as retaliation, as there are only so many of us taking a course at a time; it's not hard to figure out who might have flagged plagiarism. Plagiarism cheapens the value of the credential that is being issued here. The disincentives to prevent plagiarism from Coursera are clearly not strong enough, and it really marred my experience of this course. ",3
7203,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Michael D,"Aug 5, 2016","This course was terribly underwhelming. There is no interaction from the Wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study. Grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis. of Any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context. Very disappointed in this offering. After taking the Data Analysis specialization offered through Duke University I know what a capstone course should be  and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.",1

The research and development of your strategy, and applying the analytics skills you have learnt is where the real work is and would parallel the sort of rigor that would go into a real world situation strategic deck.
Of course it would be ideal if the project was assessed by a Wharton professor. However, that would significantly change the cost structure.

7214,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,Jeffrey H,"Aug 21, 2016","As others have said, the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials. However, the capstone project was a waste of time. Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me. In addition, the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1/3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all. This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses. I expected a lot more from a Wharton-led course - very disappointing.",1

7233,Business Analytics Capstone by University of Pennsylvania,ANIL K,"Nov 10, 2020","If you have completed all 4 courses and got a place in the Capstone project - Go for it !!   There are multiple benefits (1)  its an excellent way of putting theory into practice   (2) you will be able to interact with your classmates through peer review exercises - you may get some valuable feedbacks on your submission work (3) it provides access to additional reading material, videos which I found quite useful.   
Pl don't expect any high level number crunching assignments.  However you will certainly be able to sharpen your analytical ability, thinking through data, time management skills while structuring the submissions.  Also a great sense of accomplishment with Specialization certificate.  The project is accompanied with few Application Exercises that helps in revisiting and refreshing the courseware.   
I have read some reviews where delays in peer feedbacks have been mentioned.  I have not faced any such issue.  Submit your assignment well in time and you will get all the support. 
I compliment Wharton faculty for designing this excellent programme with a superb teaching pedagogy.   I truly cherish every lecture.

The material has been prepared with evident hurry and superficiality but the more disgusting thing is the total absence of assistance and support. There are evident problems with the grader, reported by several users, and no one has been giving an answer since the course startup. If this is the quality of service provided by Coursera, there is non hope that I'll engage a new course in the future.",1
7339,AI For Medical Treatment by DeepLearning.AI,Adithya P A,"Jun 2, 2020","The whole specialization was well-designed in such a way that even an engineering graduate with very less knowledge about statistics, probability, and also machine learning could understand what was taught. All the videos were short and crisp to the point and were quite explanatory. The assignments were really good and sometimes challenging which really made me think about the solutions. Except for the week 1 quiz that was repetition from last course others were really good. The entire experience as a CS undergrad new to AI in the field of medicine was great. Hope we get to experience similar courses in due course of time. Thank you!!!",5

7341,AI For Medical Treatment by DeepLearning.AI,Andrei-Claudiu R,"Nov 19, 2020","This course was quite disappointing. Although I expected more, given the track record of deeplearning.ai, this course felt rushed, and more of a practice in good coding rather than giving any knowledge or advanced intuition into the applications of AI in medical treatment. The first assignment in particular felt like it was mostly testing the student's ability to use fancy python package syntax than anything else. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this course at the point of competition (November 2020). I think students are far better learning the AI methods described in this course on their own, and only then learn their applications in medicine if this is required for their work. At the end of the day, data is data no matter what we're looking at. This is not to say that this course cannot improve in the future. To be fair, I would actually hope it does, to keep the great standard that deeplearning.ai has gotten us used to over the years. ",1

As this course is not about the deep knowledge, then why are you making us implement cross-validation in raw python when it is already implemented in standard packages? Better teach how to use it from there, IMHO. And the original code full of things like `from utils import *`, global variables, etc.",4

7433,AI For Medical Treatment by DeepLearning.AI,Mark L,"Jan 8, 2021","I thought the course was well-taught and interesting, but I felt that it was more of an Introduction  -- Here are some things you can do with AI and ML techniques in the context of Medicient -- rather than a detailed explanation of how the techniques work and how to use them in practice, so probably more valuable for Medical professionals than AI/ML specialists.   It would be great to have some follow-on courses that get deeper into the technical details; the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization is a great example.
In general, the programming exercises were valuable and engaging, but  I have a particular gripe with the grading:   In some cases, I had to spent quite a bit of time making micro-adjustments to my program text to satisfy the rather picky criteria of the grader, including one case were I had to remove spaces between tokens in an expression in order to pass.   I really think the criterion for grading should be correctness of results rather than conformance of the program text.",3

7441,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Neil H,"Nov 3, 2021","Excellent.
BEFORE this course: I’ve done a number of Coursera courses before. Whilst they are good, the level of learning tends to be superficial.
THIS is the first time I've dona a series of course (a module). These are the best courses I’ve taken and (after 3) I now feel I have learnt a very significant amount. Below applies to all three courses.
I have seen someone criticize the course by saying ‘it is just them talking through the Sutton & Barto book’. In defense: (i) the book *does* seem to be *the* seminal introductory text, (ii) importantly, they have selected which bits to cut out, (iii) I have now read through the recommended chapters as part of the course and have far greater insight than if just reading the book myself.
In some cases, the slides show things clearer than in the book. In some cases, the sentences are far too complicated to digest oinne one go. You need to rewind again and again to understand things.
I have found the time taken to do the Python assignments to be much longer than they suggest but this is largely down to my lack of Python abilities. I lot of time was spent improving my Python – which was a good by-product. The intermediate checking of code (within Jupyter) could be better but the forums help.",5
7442,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Maxim V,"Jan 24, 2020","Good content, but there was a highly unpleasant surprise in the programming assignments, namely this: ""Retakes: You can attempt this assignment 5 times every 4 months."" First of all, this is a highly unusual and therefore unexpected requirement on Coursera. Also, considering how buggy graders are and that some assignments require submitting results separately from the notebook, this is a really high risk of having to wait 4 months for another chance.",3

So important to read the chapters in the book ahead of time. Book is also excellent!! I liked the way the instructors explained the equations and broke them down. Nicely done!! I wish some more of the questions in the quiz reflected the data structures we use in the programming exercise, which will be super-helpful to reinforce the concepts when we do the programming exercises. In other words, an intermediate step of a worked example between the Pseudo-Code Algorithm in the Texbook/Lectures and the Programming Exercise. For example, more of the Feature_Vector -> Action_Value Calculation - even if we have to do some matrix manipulation by hand, that'd be wonderful.

book. The notebooks got me ""making something real"" with the material in a way that deepened my understanding beyond a theoretical/pen-and-paper treatment. I appreciate the care that went into setting up the RL learning environment, creating test cases, and visualizations of performance -- it's awesome when the agents come together and you can see how well they perform!
A couple very minor notes on the lectures. The pacing of speech by Dr. Adam White often felt stiff and clipped. In future video courses he might benefit from practicing changing his tone, speed, and pauses to sound more natural. Similarly, Dr. Martha White's microphone was positioned in such a way that her breathing between sentences is captured, and sounds pretty loud. Improving these aspects of presentation in the future can make the lectures flow more naturally and reduce some friction from the distractions.
Those are nits on an otherwise excellent course. Thank you very much for putting the materials together! See you in the next one!",5
7449,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Maximiliano B,"Mar 31, 2020",The third course of the specialization is excellent and it provides a solid foundation on problems with arbitrarily large state spaces that rely on approximate solution methods. The lectures are very well explained. It’s strongly recommended to read each book chapter in advance before watching the lectures to be able to better understand the concepts and be able to answer the quizzes. The content in this course is quite abstract and it is heavily dependent on statistics and calculus. It was very nice to integrate reinforcement learning with neural networks as part of one of the assignments as well as to implement the swing-up pendulum. I am looking forward to begin the capstone project.,5
7450,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,D. R,"Dec 31, 2019","Excellent course. The videos, quizzes, and especially the exercises add a lot of extra value to the text book (which is available for free - Sutton and Burto, 2nd edition). Of course it is not perfect - the videos are sometimes a bit dry, the NN part was brushed over too quickly for a beginner (luckily I had taken some courses about deep learning, so I was ok - but if you don't know the basics of NN, week 2 might be quite challenging for you). Other than that the biggest disadvantage is that the course forums are still quite empty - and so if you get stuck you can be on your own... But you shouldn't get stuck, and I guess this will improve over time. ",5
7451,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Mark J,"Oct 23, 2019","This, the third in an exceptionally well-paced series of four courses on Reinforcement Learning, extends the scope of the subject to include parameterized functions (i.e., neural networks). The section on tiling methods is especially interesting. The course is taught under the auspices of professors who, quite literally, wrote the book on reinforcement learning, and includes several video lectures by leading practitioners and theorists in the field. The final programming assignment, in particular, made me feel like I did when I wrote my first computer program that actually did what it was supposed to way back when -- delight and amazement. ",5
7452,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Ian W,"Jun 18, 2021","Learned a lot through the course. This specialization is to teach you through the whole reinforcement learning textbook. Very informative, but the programming assignments are very difficult. 
There are many tiny details to notice while programming, and the discussion forum is not very active. I suggest find some clues from the old posts when having difficulties, and ask / answer questions as much as possible to help yourself and the others.",5
7453,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Julien T,"Nov 12, 2019","Great course and specialization. The teachers are great, the material well presented and balanced. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the field of Reinforcement Learning.

Looking forward to completing the capstone project now!",5
7454,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Gordon L W C,"Mar 23, 2020",The course is very comprehensive on the content. But I think the difficulty of this course is in some sense too high for most people who don't have a background in engineering degree due to the extensive use of advanced mathematics. I think it might be a better idea if you are focusing on a few critical algorithms that trying to cover too much algorithms which is quite overwhelming,5
7455,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Walter O A,"Dec 9, 2019","An almost overwhelming amount of material, however we managed to navigate through the thicket.

7552,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,"Ananthapadmanaban, J","Jul 20, 2020","I am disappointed with policy gradients being introduced on last week of the 3rd course. The instructors need to understand that 12 weeks is too much for introduction before starting a good project to implement the concepts with a hope to better understand them (course 4).  Policy gradients should have been introduced in week 3/4 of course 2 itself. The content before that should be made more efficient (4 weeks to understand until q-learning/sarsa and 2 weeks to understand function approximation should be enough). I realized after course 2 that Andrew Ng has 3/4 videos on RL in the recently released ML class from Stanford. I am yet to go through them, but I feel they may explain these faster with same amount of rigour. However, the stanford class assignments are not public, which makes this course still useful because of the assignments. However, thanks to the instructors for this course.",4
7553,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,PHILIP C,"Jun 19, 2021","This is a good course, but I continue to be disappointed in the lack of detail in the lectures. I fill in the detail with the Deep Mind lectures on Reinforcement Learning by David Silver. The programming assignments are difficult, not because they are challenging, but because the data structures are not well explained and the conceptual connections between the equations in the book and the code structures used for the implementation are not clear. It's like being given somebody's not-very-well-documented code and trying to figure out what they were thinking. All that said, I think that the course offers a lot and I have learned a lot from it so far. ",4
7554,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Luiz C,"Oct 4, 2019","Almost perfect, except two ~minor objections:
1/ the learning content between the 4 weeks is quite unbalanced. The initial weeks of the course are well sized, whereas week #3 and week #4 feel a touch light. It feels like the Instructors rushed to make the Course available online, and didn't have time to put as much content as they wished in the last weeks of the Course
2/ there are too many typos in some notebooks (specifically notebook of week #3). It gives the impression it was made in a rush, and nobody read over it again. Besides there seems to currently be some issue with this assignment",4
7555,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Luka K,"Jan 5, 2021","It is a good introduction to prediction and control with function approximation. Combining book and instructros results in a simple and nice explanation. What keeps it from the perfect grade are the examples. It would be nice if there are more examples and explained in a more detailed way why and how the example works. For example sometimes instructors would just say that the robot can use this, and that is mostly it. The other thing is more interactive project work. For example I would like to see how is my pendulum moving after N number of episodes. I would feel more satisfactory then.",4
7556,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Dmitry S,"Jan 5, 2020","Definitely a course to take to learn the ropes of RL. For this course, it is critical to follow and math. I'd love to give 5 stars to this course but will however take one away since the course could benefit a lot if the math was made a bit simpler to follow. The book referenced in the course is excellent and does help, but still, some more pedagogical repetition/rephrase, simplification of notation, a bit slower pace of narration would make the course even better.

As the books gets deeper into concepts and complexity so does the class, which is nice, but I felt like the depth and complexity in which the online class goes does not really keep up with the book content. Not only by skipping chapters but also by staying a bit at a too high level sometimes. Still a very good course again and really accessible, entertaining and resourceful material and instructors.",4
7558,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Steven W,"May 11, 2021","It's a great course, and they cover the basics of function approximation. The instructors were clear and knowledgeable, and the content that was covered was solid.
However, they skip some content that I feel is really important for modern RL, specifically the ""deadly triad"" regarding the convergence of off-policy approximate TD methods. They also don't discuss or link to papers on PPO or other recent advancements in RL, and I was hoping to learn more about those in particular.",4

Using another paper to study ( Experiments with Reinforcement Learningin Problems with Continuous State and Action Space) was a great idea that should be done in other courses.",4
7561,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Lucas O S,"Jan 22, 2020","Great course, deserve 5 stars. It is a good complement to the book, it adds interesting visualizations to help parse the content. The only issues were in the exercises. There are technical issues with the notebook platform where it keeps disconnecting from time to time, with no warning, and you lose your unsaved work (seems like token expiration).",4
7562,Prediction and Control with Function Approximation by University of Alberta,Anirban D,"Jul 24, 2022",Excellent instructors and good concepts and assignments help you learn by doing. My only reason for giving a 4 is that  this courses uses some internal tool (RL Glue) and hence none of the Jupyter notebooks are implementable outside.

My target was not only to get familiar with mail SQL operators, but also to understand the environment in which it is used. All this was explained in a very simple way. The course material is very good structured and the length of  each module was ideal for me as a full time employee and a mother of two. Also this was the optimal balance of theory and practice for me. Alan is a brilliant tutor! It is very important when tutor describes the backstage of the processes and warns about potential problems that could be faced because of this or that action. And Alan really inspires for further learning.
To summarise, I would recommend this course to everybody who decided to start with SQL.
Many thanks!",5
7569,The Structured Query Language (SQL) by University of Colorado Boulder,Rob v d L,"Jul 4, 2023","This starts out really nice, until after week 1 you find out that you need the site bit.io, which is sunset.

7583,The Structured Query Language (SQL) by University of Colorado Boulder,Javier,"Apr 19, 2023","Good introduction course to SQL for people who have no prior or limited knowledge about it. The lessons are well structured, with lectures and support material in each week. The instructor is knowledgeable, with prior experience working in the corporate world. It’s evident that he knows what is he talking about but does a great job by taking no assumptions while going through the lessons and I think that’s important to understand the concepts because sometimes people who are proficient in a subject take parts of it for granted and end up rushing through what they think are basic concepts and the students finish with no idea of what the instructor is talking about. This is not the case in this course and it’s helpful. Also, the speed is correct too, with pauses, clarifications and explanations of every concept that appears on the slides.
Few additional thoughts:
-There is no need to install additional software to follow the course as the practical assignments are made in a virtual environment, which is explained in the course. It’s good if you don’t want additional software running in your computer, but it has some limitations with SQL advanced commands.
-Some lessons and quizzes contain minor errors in the queries. Not a lot but there are a few, particularly in week 6.
-The course is taught in PostgreSQL, which is an open-source version of SQL. Although is similar to MySQL or MS SQL Server, it has particularities. The reasons for this choice and these differences are explained early in the course and the material is as standardized as possible to look like other SQL versions.
-The virtual environment has some particularities on its own and does not support advanced SQL commands like integrity. It’s a flaw, not a major one, but it’s present.
Breaking down the course, my rating would be:
Instructor: 5/5
Lessons & materials: 4/5
Learning by doing: 4/5
Virtual environment: 3/5",4

To be honest, I enrolled in this course because he was the instructor.  I ended up buying the Arduino TinyML kit, which contains a camera and a board to plug both, the camera and the Arduino nano 33 BLE sense ***LITE***.  I emphasize the kit contains the LITE version of the board, rather than nano 33 BLE sense.... The LITE version does not have the humidity sensor.... If you don't notice that, and you try to compile an example that uses the  HTS221 the LITE board does not have, you will spend some time debugging.... It's all good... part of the learning process...
Please keep in mind, this course is an ""Introduction to ....""; the key word is ""introduction"".  Some people complained the course was too easy for them.  Of course, if one has a lot of background before taking the course, the course may feel ""easy"".

What I admire:
courses are short and one course for one topic at a time 
practice includes fundamental parts and advanced parts 
every step is set well before the courses such as ""libname.sas"" and output.sas
SAS provides university edition for students whose organizations provide no access for them to legal SAS
Coursera offers me a chance or I wouldn't be able to join the course due to the shortage of finance
and many so on
What I have tried:
besides the answers given, I've searched for more ways to solve questions. 
I've made and uploaded my own notes in markdown format on GitHub [https://github.com/karwamey/data-analysis-notes/tree/master/sas-notes]. Here I have to announce that the note is shared for spreading the knowledge and for no commercial use. If it is involved in infringement, please contact me [jasmine_xtmo@outlook.com] to delete it. I would apologize sincerely for it in a proper way so please don't charge me :)
What I wish:
some questions, which seem like ""giveaway questions"" such as ""do you think..."", can be changed into multiple-choice questions or other types of questions.
there will be a final test for all the knowledge taught in courses such as a project or something else so that the knowledge can be applied comprehensively and organically.

There was clearly a lot of though put into the design of the course. The ""lecturers"" were clear and to the point, and were scripted ahead of time (rather than being delivered off-the-cuff), which ensured that they were well thought out. There were dozens of programming demonstrations and hands-on programming activities to be performed in SAS Studio (online access is free), so you can put what you learn right to work with very useful example data sets (which are provided in SAS Studio). Each module contains a syntax review sheet at the end, and well-designed quizzes with helpful feedback. I highly recommend this course.

SAS is a very powerful tool, that helps people do things in a few steps, that would take lines and lines of code in other languages. This however comes to the price of learning the syntax with a lot of attention and care, this course is to be taken continuously to practice practice practice. The questions are very precise and there is no room for mistakes.

8080,Microsoft Azure for Data Engineering by Microsoft,Swapnil G,"Feb 5, 2023","The course has been wonderfully structured, only small improvement I would like to recommend is to minimize the constant barrage of complex terms used.

In the courses  I stumbled upon these connections were spelled out subtlely but the approach in this course made it really click for me. He also pinpoints what are typical misunderstandings of students working with an example, where I had the chance to perfect my misperceptions on a concept I thought I understood clearly. Moreover quiz questions really tested my understanding of concepts rather than focusing on numerical calculations. Overall, he is a pro who has pedagocially crafted a very unique state of the art course. Cant wait to finish the whole spec. ",5
8112,Linear Algebra: Linear Systems and Matrix Equations by Johns Hopkins University,Joshua M,"Mar 3, 2024",This is overall a poor quality course. There is a gap between the type of content that is explained in the videos and the exercises that presented as graded material.

As someone who's always had a fascination with the intricate beauty of mathematics, this course not only met but exceeded my lofty expectations.

From the very first lesson, I was hooked. The way the material was presented made even the most complex concepts feel accessible and engaging. It's evident that the instructors poured their passion for mathematics into every aspect of the course, from the clear explanations to the challenging yet rewarding problem sets.

One of the standout features of the course was its emphasis on practical application. Rather than simply memorizing formulas, I learned how to approach problems with a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. This newfound knowledge not only boosted my confidence but also made me appreciate the elegance of algebra in everyday life.",5

It gives a great introduction to many of modern and old machine learning models, and a brief glimpse in dealing with unbalanced data; a subject you can freely explore on your own. The strongest part of this course are the guided demos, they are excellent to see things happen in real time, with many ah-ha! moments, and filled code you can adapt to other projects. 
However, there's a catch; to me, a big one. The guided demos; although excellent, are flawed. If you follow the practices presented in the demo, you generate a lot of data leakage into the predictions. Specially when doing cross validation with gridsearch, since the training is not done with a pipeline. Be careful when implementing your own machine learning models after following this course.",5

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE CLASS: The material is sufficient for the topic at hand, and is structured in an appropriate way. If you work through everything you'll have a decent grasp of exactly what the class is meant to be about. It's also pretty well paced. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE CLASS: Dr. Lee usually rushes through or skips discussions what concepts mean before formalizing them mathematically. As a result it's very easy to make progress through the class without a good feeling that you actually ""get"" what Bayesian statistics is really about. Too many of these videos are him chopping wood through the mathematical jingo, when the material DESPERATELY needed a 3-5 minute introductory video about what concepts actually mean or how to think about them. I remember telling my girlfriend during the middle of the class that I found it frustrating because I was progressing through it quickly, and getting the quizzes right, but lacked a good intuition for how to think about Bayesian statistics. So Dr. Lee......work on those presentation skills! Think deeply about how to communicate the essentials of the concepts in each lesson, and THEN start pounding away on the whiteboard!",3

8272,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Scott S,"Oct 29, 2018","This course gives an introduction to the theoretical basics of Bayesian statistics. Before taking this class, I had a very confused view of the whole Frequentist vs Bayesian ""debate"". I understand now that Bayesian statistics is really about attaching uncertainties to beliefs and producing a clear definition of this uncertainty (especially through the notion of credible intervals).
The course really focusses on theory. I recommend knowing a bit of basic stats concepts before taking the class, such as Bayes' Theorem, basic discrete and continuous distributions, and confidence intervals. If you are not experienced with these, be aware that you will likely need to read-up on them throughout the course. R is used, but the usage is so simple that you should not shy away due to a lack of R experience.
I really have no complaints about the course. After completing it, you should understand the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches. You will also understand a lot of terminology that gets thrown around in data science these days (priors, posteriors, credible intervals).",5
8273,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Georgi S,"Sep 1, 2017",Good intro to Bayesian Statistics.  Covers the basic concepts.

8274,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Martin E,"Apr 13, 2017","I get lost a bit too often. 
The teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones (e.g. exponential distribution is explained as ""for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes"" and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on, but he does not say WHAT IT MEANS - is it the probability that I will meet an oncoming bus? is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus? is it the average waiting time? is it average number of buses that come every hour? - but there is detailed explanation of what A squared means in lesson two (!))
The teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula gives.
But I take it as a challenge and I intend to finish the course despite all of that. Sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations. And maybe it is me, maybe I was not born to be a statistician. Maybe there are people that find this stuff easy and understand it right away.
I really like the quizes. They are HARD.

8278,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Josef B,"Mar 21, 2022","  What I like about this course is that it goes into mathematical details and gives students with no or very limited prior knowledge about Bayesian statistics (even though some familiarity with general statistics is required) a pretty comprehensive introduction. Having almost completed the course, in retrospective I can say that I have learned a lot and also gained some intuition about Bayesian Statistics. However, here comes the problem: I think that I learned most when I resorted to textbooks or YouTube after not having understood the content provided by the instructor. The instructor does not try at all to provide intuition, he rather reads formulas from his notes and then writes them down. Of course, a topic this complicated requires that students do some additional work. However, Mr. Lee is definitely not a good teacher, and worse, he does not even try to be one – even a good teacher would not be able to convey a topic like exponential distribution and its usage in Bayesian statistics in just 4 minutes. In short: very good structure of the course, but pretty bad teaching style.

I would have preferred if the examples in the lessons in which prior and posterior were introduced went beyond the ""coin flipping"" binomial examples.  I've taken a number of stats classes, and while coin flipping is to stats as ""hello world"" is to computer programming, I feel that students would grasp the importance of Bayesian inference much better if more realistic examples were used.  Related to this, while the theory is important and understanding how to integrate the likelihoods is useful for grasping key concepts, nobody in practice really does this.  You're going to use a programming language like R or some kind of stats package.  More focus on these would be good.",4
8290,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Eunylson L,"Dec 8, 2021","It's a great course. I definetely recommend it. It's a great course also for us to understand the mathematics of Bayesian statistics. I would say that this course is more appropriate for those who already have a proper intuition of Bayesian statistics, philosophicaly speaking. Then you should come here to formalize your understanding with math. 

I give 4 stars just because in some of the classes the teacher skips some important math explanations and foundations (so we can easily get lost). Also, we could have spent more time on the applications of Bayesian statistics.",4
8291,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",עשהאל ב,"Feb 28, 2019"," a really good  course!
though sometimes the questions in quizes aren't clear enough,or not explaind else where,and sometime you could miss the big picture. 
could also be good if you could add some python scripts,and maybe more reading material about the topics. ",4
8292,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Leandro G G,"Oct 23, 2019","This course provides a good overview to Bayesian statistics, but a larger dose of explanations of would be very useful. Mr Lee discusses, in the beginning, the differences between frequentist and bayesian paradigm. I feel that this would be beneficial in the other parts of the course, too. I feel that many of the lectures simply go too fast. After lectures full of Math, it would be useful to present lectures analyzing what had just been taught, in order to better grasp the content. And in general, this happens through the whole course - most lectures are basically math, without much time for grasping the intuition and underlying logic. For example: in the final part, under linear regression, it might be be difficult to grasp what a bayesian predictive interval means. All in all, I recommend this MOOC, but you might find hard to fully grasp it.",3
8293,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Philip M,"May 29, 2020","Found the pace of the course to be a little uneven - sometimes jumps from basic introductions (good) to somewhat advanced concepts rather quickly.  The sound quality was also a bit uneven, but improved with the later videos.  Please wear dark clothing so that writing on the see-through board is readable - again, this improved with later videos.
Biggest suggestion for improvement is to provide downloadable lecture notes - having to take notes while the lecture is in process is distracting, and takes us back to the bad old days of ""talk and chalk"".
All of that said, the class was a very useful introduction, even though the application I have in mind requires discrete Bayes rather than continuous.  I will be taking a look at the second course in this series.",3
8294,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Carmen R,"Apr 10, 2020",This is was a really difficult course. I took a basic statistics course in college but was not prepared for the calculus and the theoretical way this course was explained. If you are looking for a stats course that explains through real-world examples rather than theory - this ain't it. The only reason I gave it 2 and not a 1 star is because I can assume that those with a deeper statistical background would probably not face the challenges I did. ,2
8295,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Siddhant R,"Jun 20, 2020","The course is more of remembering rather than understanding.

No time is wasted deriving formulas or proving theorems, making it a great course for anyone interested purely in applications. Toward the end, examples and practice problems tend to focus only on a few distributions (which is probably due to time constraints), but by then, you already have a decent understanding of the types of problems you can solve, so it isn't very hard to Google examples with different starting points. Overall, it's a very manageable course (especially if you take notes), and it does a good job of introducing you to a new branch of statistics even if you aren't fresh out of your last calculus class.",5

The quizzes are strategically crafted to exercise practical tasks, from the algebraic deductions (that can easily scale up in complexity on models) to simulations in R or Excel. I personally suggest to the student to do each one of the quizzes, in R and in Excel, it is an excellent opportunity to learn. ",5
8300,"Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis by University of California, Santa Cruz",Benjamin J S,"Apr 28, 2024","Excellent course. 

Particularly the exercises are extremely useful with actual hints and explanations, rather than just telling one is right or wrong. Assignments vary in difficulty and there is one tough quiz whose answer one can only find in a side-note of the additional material, so that was somewhat frustrating. 

The Forum, unfortunately, as with most MOOC's is practically useless and its difficult to ask for qualified help, should one be stuck. Also, the lectures on Jeffrey's prior and the Fisher Information should be covered more extensively.

The extra-material is very good, though and written in LaTeX.

I was totally hooked on to this and the quizzes with real world examples really helped understand and apply the concepts. This course definitely requires  maths background to be able to complete.

The topics are, for a number of distributions (bernoulli, binomial, normal), how to compute posterior from prior. All lectures are organized similarly to each other: to introduce a measure, the lecturer calculates it assuming starting distributions. Prerequisites are a minimal knowledge of how to calculate derivatives and integrals, so not advanced knowledge. The tests are simple but at the same time useful to consolidate the concepts introduced in the lectures. I recommend this course. ",5

However, if you are like me, you will have problems following the lectures at the speed at which the professor proceeds. It's a minor 'subjective' issue. The second issue is that sometimes, the equations in the quizzes may appear in the form of ""cryptic codes"", for the lack of better words, and you'll know it if you face it. A change of browser solves the problem, for me a shift from Chrome to Safari did the trick! Hope this helps. ",5

8496,Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow by IBM,Roger P,"Sep 1, 2021","This is a good introduction to Tensorflow. Like all Coursera courses I've experienced to date, there were plusses and minuses. 
The good side of each of these courses:
* The courses cover the main concepts (building models, limitations, challenges, etc). They covered activation functions, Convolutions, width and depth of models, Gradient Descent and learning rate issues. 
* The lessons don't oversimplify, but give you the tools you need to explore further on your own if you wish. 
* Replies to my forum questions were actually surprisingly quickly answered. I was expecting the forums to be filled with months-old unanswered questions.
* Being able to replay videos was invaluable. 
The less-good side:
* The exams are token, often multiple choice with unlimited retries. That is fine.  
* The lessons are often replete with misspellings,  grammar errors and ambiguous quiz questions. 
* Sometimes, due to the stochastic nature of ML models, the errors/mispredictions differ between the Grading Rubrics and legitimately obtained results. 
Would I do it again? My answer is this- I feel for six courses I have the equivalent of one junior-level semester survey course's worth of information and experience. However I was able to do it on my own time starting immediately, at my own pace, replaying the lectures at will and all for a tiny fraction of the cost and time of a college course. I do believe I have a starting point to pursue more advanced topics and for that I believe it was well worth it. ",4
8497,Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow by IBM,Prent R,"Dec 8, 2021","I felt the labs failed to illustrate the reasons why we were learning the concepts. They did not use examples that would have shown how the tools would have value with real projects. For example: Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow/ML0120EN-3.1-Reveiw-LSTM-basics only illustrated some very limited concepts. Instead of an example that had value, it was just variables and numbers. The same is true for labs_ML0120EN-3.2-Review-LSTM-LanguageModelling_with_results.ipynb. It did not actually model anything of relevance. It had a section on # Define the gradient clipping threshold, without explaining why that is important. This was true with most of the exercises. When I compare that with a course like Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras the differences are vast. Keras is a simple interface and all the examples were clear and had real world applications for business. Not so with this course. A huge disappointment, and a terrible waste of time.",4
8498,Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow by IBM,Omri,"Aug 14, 2020","This is a great course and a great instructor. I also loved his course on Machine Learning with Python. My major criticism, relevant also for the course on Keras in the AI Engineering program, is that the lectures and labs are not updated to the new versions of packages. The new versions of Tensorflow, Tensorflow2.0, were changed significantly relative to the version used here. Moreover, Keras in now TensorFlow's official high-level API, which means that the code learned in these courses cannot be used for new data without implementing the new syntax of these libraries. I hope IBM will update the learning material more frequently so these wonderful courses will keep being relevant.

8499,Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow by IBM,A A A,"Jul 7, 2020","The instructor Saeed Aghabozorgi did an excellent job in explaining the concepts in a way everything can be understood easily. However, I still think 5 weeks is not enough for this course, given TensorFlow is more difficult to learn than PyTorch. The basics could be covered in more detail, including the tf.get_variable(), tf.gradient(), calculating gradients and other functions that were used. There could be a lecture for Linear Regression and Logistic Regression and these 2 could be moved to a separate week instead. Also, please upgrade the code to work on TensorFlow 2.1. The current code designed for TensorFlow 1.8 didn't work especially the part where datasets are to be loaded. ",4

The presentation slides are really well done. The examples are programmed in TensorFlow. But the course does not really teach very much about TensorFlow itself. The opening lecture on TF describes it in terms that suggest this was created for TF 1.x, rather than the new structure in 2.x. But that turns out not to be an issue since they go into little detail on TF itself. 
The programming examples are really good. However, most of the time, the CognitiveCourse.ai web site on which they run is usually not working. So you often cannot use the labs in conjunction with the lectures. You have to go back and access the labs sometime when the website is working. ",3
8532,Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow by IBM,Michael C,"Sep 11, 2020","While the lab and videos explained the concepts really well, the codes from the labs are outdated.

Poorly crafted video scripts, which are also poorly edited (if at all) when the poor hosts dealing with this awful writing stumble. There are entire sections of video where there are 1-2 sentences (or less) of content that actually reflects or supports the title of the section. It is not training for AI, but 95% propaganda. It's a sales pitch about the wonders of AI. It is not aimed at any professional working in the tech industry, and not for anyone who already has a passing idea of what AI is. It is merely hype, with a ridiculous level of hyperbolic claims about the ""magic, wonder, and wizardry"" of AI. There is no training in this training. The tests are similarly terrible.

8593,Introduction to Relational Databases by Illinois Tech,Summer M,"Mar 11, 2024","The video materials were very helpful, but the two textbooks were problematic: one was a basic, open source textbook that gave poorly-written definitions of terms with little to no useful context or applications; the second was a very dense relational algebra textbook that was difficult to parse, with little to no context provided by the video assignments. Several of the quiz questions were coded incorrectly (as in: the correct answer was marked 'incorrect' in the quiz). When this was pointed out, Coursera reps acknowledged the mistake but said nothing could be done to correct my quiz. The final exam included material that was either not covered in class or was barely mentioned in one of the textbook readings. It was formatted completely differently from all other quizzes and practice assignments, including the fact that there was no sample database to query when answering the SQL questions. I would not recommend this course to others.",1

He simply worked through a long list of tasks with no narrative to explain why each skill might be useful in practice.

8694,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,ELISA W,"May 18, 2018","I am torn about this class.  On one hand, there was some good information, and I definitely learned more throughout the course.  On the other hand, as a biologist trying to learn programming, this course was insufficient.  Very little of the programming code was explained (and considered obvious?).  I spent a lot of time googling to understand the code so that I could not only learn but complete the assignments.  There are some concepts (like the use of __init__) which I still do not understand.  Also, the ""hints"" to accomplish the homework assignments were definitely not well explained.  I only managed to increase the speed of my programs by going through the discussion forums for hours until I found something that helped.  
Also, as a biologist, it is obvious that this course is not designed so that a computer programmer learns much about the biology.  A simple (but necessary!!) change would be to refer to the left and right as 5' and 3'.  Using biological terminology would have helped me understand what the lecturer was talking about.
Plainly, this is a course for a computer person to learn more code.  It could be taught to do so much more!!  ",3

There is no info as to if Windows 7 is required. + It appears there is no support either. I have loaded linux on my window 10. Will try coursera 5 one more time.

The instructors were very passionate and clear, and there was a good balance between learning about biology and the programming aspect. However, for somebody that only has the programming knowledge from Course 3 of the Genomic Data Science Specialization (Python for Genomic Data Science), that course, I believe, is too light for the new Python concepts taught in this course. I believe that before taking this course, you may need more background knowledge for Python.

Lectures are very well prepared, practicals provide step-by-step explanations of the scripts (which is especially useful for people with little coding experience) and homeworks are well thought through, so that they force students to use the knowledge gained in the module. Some of the homeworks are challenging, but all the information needed to do the exercises is provided in lectures and practicals. All the notebooks containing scripts are provided, which makes it easy to take notes and better understand the scripts by running some examples. The way the concepts are explained in the lectures (the computational problem is described in details and then the ways of dealing with it are carefully explained in order of increasing complexity) provides insight into not only how these algorithms work but also why (what is the purpose/cause/reason behind these solutions). I can imagine how much work and thought went into preparation of these lectures and I honestly admire the teachers for their efforts.

In addition to being an excellent computer scientist, he is also an excellent teacher and he makes the material interesting and approachable.  The homework assignments are challenging, but created in such a way that the difficulty lies more in grappling with the concepts themselves, and less with debugging python code or whatever.  I highly recommend this course, and hope that Ben will do a ""Algorithms: Part Two"" covering Burrows-Wheeler and going into more depth, maybe discussing pseudo-alignment as well.  ",5

8718,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,DBel,"May 27, 2023","As a biologist with minor experience in bioinformatics (and coding in R), I found the contents of this course extremely well presented and conveyed in a very clear manner. The practicals were very helpful in understanding the code behind the algorithms, even though some more advanced code was not explained, which is fine.  Kudos to both the instructors! I recommend this course to anyone who is working with NGS data and is interested to learn how  tools like salmon or bowtie work in principle. Now, I finally learned how Fastq files are built and what information they carry and what a genome index is. 12 hours to complete is definitely an understatement, though. The homeworks are challenging and give you the opportunity to hone your Python and computational thinking skills. Too bad, this course is not supported or updated any more. I hope there will be a revamp at some point. ",5
8719,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Bhavana K,"Sep 19, 2020",Amazing is the only word i can say. The tutors Ben and Jacob have seemed to have put in a lot of hardwork into designing such a world class material with all well curated examples and lectures. Just i wish the programming assignments were a little bit more thought provoking than just changing a couple lines of that they already have taught us but otherwise an absolutely wonderful course from JHU. I learnt so so much about Bioinformatics algorithms. Thank you !!,5
8720,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Julia O,"Apr 19, 2017",I really appreciate how much effort the authors have put into the course 'Algorithsms for DNA sequencing'. The clarity of the lectures is absolutely amazing and the assignments are doable. The assignments took me a lot of time because my only programming background is the 'Python for Genomic Data Science' course. Another really positive aspect about this course is  that it helped to consolidate the python coding I had learned in the previous course.,5
8721,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Gregory S,"Mar 30, 2016","This is a good (albeit short) introduction to algorithms for DNA sequencing. The instructor does a good job of explaining some select algorithms as well as the pitfalls they may have. The programming assignments are short but fairly challenging for inexperienced programmers. If you like this course, you will enjoy the 6-part Bioinformatics specialization from UCSD on Coursera where they go into these algorithms in much more detail.  ",5
8722,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Yue H,"Dec 30, 2016",The lectures and practicals are very easy to understand. The programming homework is a little bit hard for a python beginner to finish. I wish there are more hints or test examples. It would be better to include some reference papers for those who are more interested in the sequencing techniques and methods to read by themselves. And it would be very nice to have a summary slide at the end of the course.,5
8723,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Thomas L,"May 26, 2017","Great course. For the complexity of the subject, the presentations are relatively easy to follow because the teacher is articulate and clear and the slide decks are informative. The homework assignments are challenging but not frustratingly so. I would recommend some familiarity with a programming language (although knowledge of Python in particular is not necessary) and some interest in bioinformatics. ",5
8724,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Ricardo B L,"Dec 31, 2020","Some homework questions could have more detailed explanations of what is wanted , but overall there are  examples to test the python codes needed for the assignments help a lot, although for some you can get the example results even if you done something wrong (and then the code not give the expected result for the homework questions). Besides that the course is very good, well explained and presented. ",5
8725,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Burak,"May 17, 2017","This was a very good course! It delivers what it promises successfully and help understand the problem of DNA sequencing. It is a very helpful course, explains domain terms and constructs a background for people that have no background in bioinformatics. It also addresses problems, algorithms that are used in this field and in programming assignments, it forces for the learner to implement them. ",5
8726,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Robert D,"Aug 15, 2019","Of the first four courses in the specialization, this is by far the best.  The instructor is incredibly clear, teaches with an obvious interest in student learning, and conveys complex topics incredibly well.  The practical sessions are an amazing addition and it is impressive to watch the algorithms come alive in such an elegant fashion.  Both instructors in the practicals are exceptional.  ",5
8727,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Nicholas Y,"Jan 11, 2019","This is one of the best courses I've seen so far, that explains and showcases main principles, fundamentals of genomics, algorithms.

Finally ,thank you for your work",5
8731,Algorithms for DNA Sequencing by Johns Hopkins University,Damian D,"Jul 15, 2020",Definitely you need to know some basic python. The better your programming skills the better basically. But other than that the course is fantastic. The tutors explain all the smallest details very well and exams are very clear.

8819,AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning by IBM,Hernán C,"Apr 2, 2020","Its takes to long to train the models (6 hours each case). I was lucky because some students give me de advice to use google Free GPU to complete the each train in 2 minutes. Without the students tips It is impossible.
I suggest to add to this course information about to use either cuda with own local jupyter lab or either recommend some serice like googel colab to get better performance.",3
8820,AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning by IBM,Jeremiah J,"Feb 25, 2020","I guess the course was OK, but the complete limitations of the ""provided"" compiling environment is inexcusable.  I tried five different emulators, eventually using Google's Colab tool in order to get any type of results within six hours.  I don't know what you can do, but something needs to be done.
Also, I would recommend NOT having two different tracks (Keras & Pytorch).  Because of the aforementioned coding issues, most of the real instruction occurs in the discussion forum.  It is INCREDIBLY confusing when there are essentially two different assignments posting questions in the same space.

I am not really sure about the value of the certificate, one of the students I reviewed had obviously just copied and pasted his responses directly from the rubric.

Jupyter Notebooks on IBM Cognitive Lab struggles to just unzip the dataset (which is downloaded as a zip), not to even mention fitting the models to the data, which I found to be impossible to do with IBM Cognitive labs (for both week 3 and the final assignment). Ultimately I ended up having set up a jupyter lab environment on my own laptop, the problem is even then it took about 14 hours to fit the data to the models (in total, both week 3 and final assignment).

I'm talking about his teaching style which is slow and painful. Following suggestions from other reviews increased the speed of the video so I can bear listen to him. He needs to drop the unnecessary jokes and focus on the teaching delivery. He also needs to include more visual aids as he talks. This is not abstract module about theorising. It is important to have the slides along what he's saying. Also, some of the material in his long lectures are not covered but then included in the reading. For an intro course this should be corrected. He needs to introduce all important concepts that will appear in the quiz. In his lectures he goes on and on and on and the substance of each lecture is like only 1/5 of the actual length of the lecture. Finally, there's a script issue with the formulae in the quizzes. You end up relying on other learners to find out what the problem is. The tutor needs to be responsible for this. ",2

Just say ""mean"" instead of ""X bar."" I am a firm believer that if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

9040,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Daniel M,"Nov 7, 2019","A great course/specialization, and the one in reinforcement learning you were looking for. A lot of work has been put into creating this specialization. Maybe a bit less into this last course (capstone) which consists of a patchwork of lectures from previous courses and some new ones. The capstone project is not fundamentally different from assignments in previous courses. Be aware, even if you’ve made it through the whole specialization it most likely doesn’t mean that you will be ready to return to your own area of interest/expertise and implement an RL project from scratch.

However, this course seems to not be fully thought-through. I didn't love the re-inclusion of videos I had already seen in the past (which were sometimes only tangentially-related to that week's topic). The programming assignments were either way too easy (#1 and #3) or way too difficult/involved/long (#2).

If that's your case, don't waste any more time or money somewhere else: this course is the course you are needing. It will take you step by step (always) from the basics of bandits to MDP solutions and from tabular algorithms to more sophisticated function approximation algorithms.

However, the projects are TERRIBLE.  They could actually be very good, but there is simply not enough information in the descriptions to be very useful.  None of the lectures discuss the details of how to implement any of the topics and the projects basically set things up but provide no information on what is actually expected to be done.  They need to either discuss the basics or provide pointers to resources that provide that description.

9049,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Andreas F,"May 2, 2023","Hello!
As there is no place to review the complete specialization, I'll do it at this place.
I general I think I learned a lot and have now a good foundation of RL.
But on the other side IMHO there is the need for some improvements:
1. Questions get not answered at all: I asked some questions through the course and did not get an answer to one of them.
2. The textbook you provided does not fit to the way I'm learning: much too much text and not enough (mathematical) proves. It would be good to have alternative readings here.
3. Some of the tests in the assignments are not ok: they leave you in the impression that everything is fine - until at some point later there is the need to review everything. This is IMHO a waste of time - a test should test all (or at least) the most possibilities.
4. I'm missing something like course no 5. All the details are now introduced - and now the 'real work' on a architectural and conceptual level can start. But there is nothing like this.
5. It would be good to generally update the python assignments that they work with the lastest versions of their dependencies. The problem is that with the current setup it is mostly impossible to develop and execute the assignments locally. (e.g. gym 0.21 might be updated to the latest gymnasium, in one assignment even the random number generator does not fit, that the local version failed but the online succeeded (IMHO the concept relying on the same random numbers is a bit brittle, might fail and introduced a lot of questions and work))
6. Please use environments like tensorflow for handling NN. As I understood, this is not an introduction to NN - so just use what is there (there is no need to develop (again) an Adam optimizer - it does not really help to understand RL.",3
9050,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Neil H,"Nov 11, 2021","The same review for all 4 courses: This is the first time I have done a Coursera module building courses up rather than just individual courses. You really feel you have achieved something out of it. Some people have commented that it is just presenting material from the Sutton and Barto book. But that book is *the* text book in the subject. The course selected particular chapters from the book. I wouldn't have got as much just from trying to read the book on its own (I probably wouldn't have read as much as I did). It was good to have the supplementary videos with other experts  - and great to watch Sutton and Barto just sat down being recorded having a retrospective conversation. The programming exercises would sometimes feel they weren't testing much (in fact, the challenges were largely due to my lack of skill in Python - my Python abilities have improved which is a side benefit) but they would actually get you into the weeds as it were. All in all, the best courses I've done. Great job Martha and Adam!",5

The content it did have was solid and the instructors were great. The ""capstone"" was creating an agent to solve the Moon Lander problem, and much of the code was already written.
I would have really preferred getting experience with a real RL framework like RLLib or acme, rather than the toy libraries used by the book. It would have also been really nice to have a little more freedom and challenge, such as making us actually create an agent to solve an MDP of our own choosing and definition.",4
9052,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Oleksii K,"Sep 19, 2020","I wish that this course contained more practical advice. 
The video describing the problem and the notebook describing the problem contradict each other in many details.
Also, the name of the course is a bit misleading. Instead of building ""A Complete Reinforcement Learning System"" and covering all of the building blocks of an RL project, the homeworks were mainly focused on training the agent, very similar to most previous assignments. So it was more about doing the same one thing in more depth rather than doing more different things.",3

9061,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Connor W,"Apr 1, 2021","This is my overall review for all the courses in this specialization. In my opinion, this specialization can be a good supplement to the RL textbook. There are some instances where the lecture video can describe certain content better than the textbook. One should also remember that the depth covered by this specialization is much less compared to the textbook, therefore one is still strongly encouraged to read the textbook thoroughly to have a better understanding of the topics. Other good things to be said about this specialization is that the Jupyter notebook exercises are rather well-prepared. However, the last course (Capstone) was actually surprisingly easy, so although the course estimates 6 weeks worth of content, I feel it's more towards 1-2 weeks (could be even less if you skip the review lessons which are duplicates of videos in previous courses). Throughout the courses there are also guest lecture videos. Most of them are interesting enough, although for some the content may be too far from course content (perhaps even textbook).

In addition, I had a great time watching the videos with other professors and special guests such as the one with David Silver and Joelle Pineau.

However, you'll find that from Course 2 onwards (and this one especially), very little hand holding is given for the programming assignments. Command of numpy and python at good  level are expected. Personally, having worked with OpenAI gyms before starting this specialization helped me immensely. As the instructors state, this course lays the foundation for future studies. The field of RL is simply so complex that even foundational work is challenging. Overall, a great course.",4
9141,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Henry C,"Oct 17, 2021","A decent course to wrap up the RL specialization, with a ""project"" that demonstrates a ""real-world"" application of RL.
The word ""project"" is in quotes because it is structured as a  (short) series of fairly short assignments with very heavy hand-holding, so very similar to previous courses.
My only complaints with this course are that the project is a bit too hand-holdy and that the course overall is quite short and thin in content. I would estimate that this course is around 1/3 the length of the previous courses in this series.",4
9142,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Jing Z,"Jun 2, 2020","The project is a decent example to go through in order to review what we learned from previous courses. However there are few key things supposed to be addressed as well: 1) What exactly the reward function is in the final project (C4M1 practice is badly designed); 2) How can we build an environment on our own; 3) Apart from Mean Squared Value Error to be minimized, what are other loss functions to choose from and what's the consideration behind.

9144,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) by University of Alberta,Dmitry S,"Jan 10, 2020","Good course. Summarises and puts everything in context.

Apparently some UI was decommissioned as of October 1st and the datasets don't open in the browser at all. Also, providing only 45 minutes to do labs where you need so much more time isn't helpful.

9172,Launching into Machine Learning by Google Cloud,Nathaniel T,"Jun 23, 2021","Although there are engaging lectures, they skip over all interesting technical detail to focus on philosophy (and of course lauding Google).  Philosophy of data analysis is all good and well, but there is no technical instruction to go with it. Quizzes and labs stress technical details for which there is no instruction.  Readings are a hodge-podge of unlabelled links with no prioritization or curation. 
Labs take 15 mintues to start up, and then have 1-2 hour timeouts, at the end of which you lose all work you have done. There is little to no instruction in the labs: the only way to do them is either already understand what their topics (making them pointeless) or to quickly google up answers to technical questions, and blindly run functions (which is also pointless).

First module talked about Tensorflow Estimator API, but does not show how they are applied in subsequent modules. They just don't flow together as a course at all. At some point, it seems to be videos taken from different places to form a course. This collaboration was not well planned at all. The course should also be accompanied with more detailed readings. 
2 labs in pairs trading and momentum trading are taken directly from Auquan. They would be better off just reading directly from Auquan instead of paying for this course.",2

Having been exposed to PyTorch previously I found Tensorflow and Keras intuitive and easy to use. The APIs are fairly similar. 
Even though the part about the trading strategies was treated not in-depth, I've enjoyed the labs and learned a lot from it, and got lots of inputs for future possible strategies. 
One downside of this course is the library used for backtesting, I wasn't able to download the data using the library, maybe because the notebooks weren't up to date with the library or the library has an undiscovered bug. Despite this little hindrance, the notebooks are really valuable!",4

9397,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Toni F,"Mar 2, 2020","I general, I can recommend this course.
I was able to learn the basics of Julia language.
The three things that stand out for me are:
Data structures, Plotting, Data Frames.
Parallel computing is not part of this course.
There are a few weaknesses in this course, but it seems that the course is being reviewed frequently, in order to adress issues, and enhance the content.
Weaknesses I found were:
Some typos and dead links in tests
In some tests, correct answers (when the code works in the computer language) are graded as incorrect, because the grading software only accepts one correct answer, rather than a variety of correct answers.
Some tests are testing your ability to pay attention in small details, rather than your ability to understand the computer language
There are not enough participants in the course for mutual grading to work properly. Instead instructors have to do grading, which often occurs with a delay of a few days.
I suggest that the course material should give more references to side information (e.g. cheat sheet for markup language, definition of SIR model, links to collections of open datasets)",4
9398,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Nuno G,"Apr 7, 2018","I found this a great introductory course on Julia for scientists. I specially loved the classes about data frames, user-defined types, and the Gadfly package.

9400,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Jonathan P,"Jun 1, 2020","Solid overall course for both introduction to Julia as well as programming as a whole.  A few aspects could be updated.  Juliabox is about to be sunset(discontinued) so it would be nice for them to walk users through using JupyterLabs in Anaconda for loading the Julia notebooks needed for the course assignment. Atom and Juno are briefly mentioned but I would recommend using these to anyone looking to take this course.  Some of the code used in the course is now deprecated, but using the error messages it is not that difficult to debug and update - though it does slow down the overall speed with which the course can be completed.

9401,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Robbie M,"Dec 9, 2020","This course was a good introduction to Julia, and it has helped me start to use Julia regularly for data analysis. I think the course would benefit from being longer and covering a greater number of topics, as it really just scratches the surface of using a coding language for scientific analysis, but in its present form it is definitely worth the money. One specific thing that the course taught me which I may not have learned had I purely taught myself, is the importance of Jupyter-style notebook environments for Julia, which given the import times of some modules, are more useful for Julia than Python.

Only negative point is that due to the evolution of Julia, some of the methods or ways to index DataFrames presented in the course have changed in the recent Julia releases. It isn't a massive problem, generally googling allows to find the new syntax quite quickly.",5
9425,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Mark L,"Aug 28, 2017","This is an excellent introduction to the Julia language. My only complaint is that the course was written when Julia 0.4.6 was the standard, so when I used the current Julia 0.6.0 some of the instructor-provided code contained deprecated functions, or did not run at all, requiring a trip to the Julia API to find the currently-used syntax. But this course is still very good in spite of the dated code.",5

The first three weeks are a gentle introduction to the methodologies of scientific, and general, computing in Julia. However, the final week's course modules are a bit on the higher side of the learning curve, and feel like a jump in the content. Maybe this Is because it was meant to be part of an honors set. Nonetheless a segue into that would certainly make the overall experience a perfectly tied up introduction! Thanks to both Dr. Klopper and Dr. Laurie for a wonderfully lucid and pleasantly personal discourse!",4
9493,Julia Scientific Programming by University of Cape Town,Ioannis M,"Mar 23, 2021","The course provides very useful knowledge for a begginer.

9524,Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning by IBM,R W,"Jul 26, 2021","This course has a larger scope than the other ML certificate courses and is a little out of date. While it introduces RL, it does not discuss TD learning or Deep RL. RL seems ""tacked on"". Similarly, there is a brief introduction to Attention, but no substantial discussion of Transformer models (I suggest dropping LSTM and talking just about Transformers). Unlike the other courses, which introduced the concepts and also covered practical steps on using these methods, the DL/RL course is a little light on the practical side of DL. There is little discussion of why particular architectures are chosen for specific problems or how sensitive those architectures are to various hyperparameters. You will know what DL, CNN, RNN (and to a lesser extent, RL) are is when you finish this course, but there's a big gap for any practical use of these tools, which was less of an issue for the (admittedly simpler/more scoped) topics in earlier courses.",3

While the previous courses were a deep dive into some statistical techniques with an intermediate complexity, this course felt like a surface level introduction to a very wide and deep topic - despite the fact that this is the longest course in the specialisation.  I don't think this is a flaw in the course, but it probably means that I need to look into more courses on deep learning in order to gain a fuller understanding of the topic.  This was a very interesting and useful introduction to the topic though!",5

9548,Rust Fundamentals by Duke University,Nitin K,"Dec 26, 2023","The course was a good intro into the rust ecosystem for Python/JavaScript devs but I would say it does miss the spark of the rust ecosystem. Instead of makefiles, justfiles or cargo xtask should've been portrayed.

The specialization doesn't have an intermediate rust course, that only focuses on the language's features. So, probably this intro course should've catered more into the advanced features? Thread safety, multithreading, async, WASM, unsafe/FFI/linking with C libs are all missed out. 
I intend to learn about Tokio's (a rust async crate for tasks) task management and WASM platform support.

The state of web frameworks(https://www.arewewebyet.org/), gaming frameworks(https://arewegameyet.rs/), machine learning frameworks(https://www.arewelearningyet.com/), and support for WASM and WASM's scope should've at least been mentioned in the intro. 
Also, linking to Microsoft learn and parts of the rust book is alright, but there should've been a proper walkthrough of the rust website, covering the rustlings course and rust by example apart from the book.
The first look given to the viewers into the rust ecosystem should've been much better.

I am planning to take up the whole specialization, so my views might change about the intermediate/advanced features of rust not being discussed. 
But I strongly feel the intro course, at least in the first week should've given a much better peek into the rust ecosystem.",4

From my point of view the first lector can be completely skipt. 

The later lectures are more focused on actual Rust. However, many explanations are very superficial, with silly examples. The labs are boring with the same silly example code and often there is not really a coding challenge but just a task like trying out all possibilities to ignore and select certain tests. On top of this, Rust analyzer did not work correctly inside the lab containers, so even basic code completion is not available.

Monarch, with his extensive experience in AI and his work with industry leaders like Google and Amazon, brings a unique and practical perspective to the course.
The course stands out in its approach to disaster management, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of AI in both the prediction and management of natural disasters. It offers a deep dive into the use of AI in predicting extreme weather events, managing disaster response, and planning for long-term recovery. The course also explores the ethical considerations in using AI in these contexts, which adds a layer of depth to the discussions.
The course content is well-structured and includes a variety of real-world case studies that illustrate the application of AI in disaster management. As a programmer, I found the course to be a rich source of intricate details and complex concepts, cleverly hidden for those who wish to explore beyond the surface.

In real world, new challenges arisen by climate change and unmet disasters often come very suddenly,  such that human society can be hurt unprepared and also have no historical data as a guide.  In this case a pretrained model that often requires large amount of existent data does not work well. By contrast, unsupervised machine learning or in-situ training iteration based on miniaturized database can offer a good solution, largely due to removal of the bias. The researchers also found a clever way to cluster the raw database and downsize the actual computation capacity without compromising its precision, as indicated by a paper in the resources. By this way, peopel can establish rapid desion making upon most recent and best available (although limited or invalidated) data information, and make the bad things under control, or separate their overall impacts into manipulable manners.

The other lecturers energy was quite obvious and the lecturer in this course does nothing extra. This is the traditional teaching method where we should keep on grasping theory without understanding applications.
While I have learned many new concepts, I am 100% unsure I have not understood the course in general.
The assignments in the course was poorly constructed and the lectures did not explain anything more about numpy methods.
I will not recommend this course to anyone.",1
9579,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Maximilian W,"Apr 30, 2019","The first two courses in the Mathematics for Machine Learning specialisation are excellent - even amongst the best online or traditional maths courses I have taken. This course was seriously lacking. Not in content, or even the ability of the lecturer, but rather in how the information is conveyed. There are some excellent reviews which elaborate further in to the problems with this course, so I will not labour over them all. In essence, if you are learning in your own free time, the poorer information transfer  is not appreciated.
However, this course is important, but if you are unsure of whether or not to invest your time into starting this course (now) , I think the following questions are good to ask. Are you:
1) fairly competent in maths, at least significantly beyond the first  two courses. This is not because the underlying maths is hard, but the way the information is conveyed, will require more firm knowledge, or, are you:
2) willing to be frustrated, and grab additional resources. You need to be patient to get the most out of this course. The previous courses were great at guiding, and in large part spoon feeding. This course is different, and you have to be happy with that.
3) proficient at numpy and python. I would invest time before the course working on basic numpy skills, as this will make the assignments much easier, and allow you to focus on implementation of learning rather than debugging, and pulling out of hair.  
The two star review is because this course didn't provide the high quality expected from the first courses, however the content and end learning result can not be questioned as poor.",2
9580,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Eric P,"Apr 26, 2019","There is little reason to take this course except for gaining the satisfaction of completing the three courses in the series. There are briefer, more satisfying introductions to PCA elsewhere. This course has too little of what made the other courses in the series so good and shares too much of their shortcomings. Where the other two courses excelled in demonstrating an intuitive understanding of both the maths and their applications, this course really avoids all effort at intuition or examples and instead just throws formula after formula at you.  You are then given programming assignments where at least half the effort is to try to understand what is being asked before you start to work to implement it. This leaves you more with a feeling of only having completed assignments and less a sense that you’ve developed a capability in either the maths or their applications. In the end, I am left with a strong desire to learn more about the maths of PCA and their application only because I am eager to hear the subject matter explained by someone else.

'Basic knowledge' simply does not make it possible to finish these exercises within the given timeframe (1-2 or even 3-4 hours).  
As many others, despite having no problem with the maths, I gave up during week 1 because of this issue and of not having this amount of free time while already working full time. This should be emphasised in the course description, apart from the extra mathematical creativity that already appears there.

However, I disagree with some of the very negative reviews. I believe the instructor does generally a good job (and is clearly extremely knowledgeable and competent) except: 
(1) Sometimes, in the derivations, he glosses over steps which are probably trivial to him, but that are not so trivial to many in the audience (in my case, I had to replay some of these derivation steps a few times until I could understand them)
(2) As some reviewers have said, a few more detailed examples here and there (as opposed to quickly flashing some sample data plots) would be helpful
(3) The instructor could use a little bit more of charisma to try to show that he is excited about the subject he is teaching, and thus make his audience more excited about it (but granted, that is a personality trait that doesn't come easy to most professors and instructors).  
As for the programming exercises, which have been amply criticized in other reviews, I agree there's little guidance on how to approach them, but for anybody with who has understood the lectures fairly well, and with enough programming experience, they should not be that hard. It's only a few lines of code that need to be written in all of the programming assignments.",4

9590,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Roy A,"Sep 23, 2020","First 2 courses in this specialization was really good, so I'm very dissappointed here. My main issues are the following:
The lectures are not clear enough, for about 75% of the assignments, I had to look up alternative lectures on youtube to get the point, if I have to find the majority of the information outside of Coursera, then what is the point of the course?
Sometimes there are no examples in the lectures, other times, the examples are too basic. So once I got a more advanced question , I was clueless how to solve it. Sometimes the first question on a quiz is much more complex than the example in the lecture.
The lectures requires you to be very comfortable with math notation, which I'm not. As mentioned earlier, some more examples would have solved this for me, but as the examples are lacking, I was simply unable to understand what was being written on the lecture, and had to look elsewhere. Note that the math itself wasn't hard(once I found someone else to explain it), just understanding what the lecturer meant. 
Some steps in lectures are missing, I guess they are obvious if you have the correct prerequisites, but to me it was just a black box. ""We have x,y,x. So then we get x+z,y!"", why? no idea, I still don't know why we get x+z. 
Programming assignments are hard for the wrong reasons, the math is not that hard, the python and numpy is basic, but the explanations of what the function is supposed to do is not clear. When I got stuck, it was usually because I didn't understand what the output of a function was supposed to be. As this is a math course, I would expect the challenge to be the math, not something else.  
To sum up the above points, I think the course lacks a good understanding of the base skills needed to complete the course. Since I had no problems with part 1 and 2, and then ran into a wall at part 3(PCA), I think these parts should be better synced, if they are to be part of the same specialization.  ",2

-The great disappointment of this course lies in the assignments. They don't really add to my understanding of the mathematics involved, and are quite often a distraction because the assignments are quite inflexible in terms of coding: you'll have to stick quite close to what the instructor envisions, or you will fail.

9597,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Thomas B,"Jun 5, 2022","While the first two courses in the specialization were excellent, the negative reviews here are on-point as this course was a terrible experience.

The prerequites don't match the course, or those of the previous courses. The course heavily uses formal mathematical language that won't be familiar to those who haven't at least taken a few upper-level university math courses. (The stated Python/numpy prerequisites are also inaccurate, but this did not trip me up as much.) Many of the concepts covered are purely academic, such as the formal definition of an inner product; there is little-to-no practical application of these concepts, meaning that much of the course is only useful if you have an interest in pure maths. Unfortunately, given that the specialization focuses on applying these concepts to machine learning, this means that the course barely helps the average learner who wants to learn more about machine learning.

The assignments are very poorly implemented. Like others have mentioned, the instructions are unclear and there are possible bugs within the tests themselves. Comments sometimes are sloppily copy/pasted between code blocks, referencing parameters that don't exist or giving an instruction that should not actually be done. The facial recognition and script recognition themes of the assignments are really cool, but the poor writing in the assignments make it really unclear how the maths you implement relate to those themes, totally undercutting any practical illustration you may hope to gain. I'll add that the ""tests"" meant to help debug your code are almost pointless, because there is no feedback on why the tests are failing; that means that whenever a test fails, you may be stuck making random changes to your code in the hope that some arbitrary change will work.
The lack of a cheat sheet is cruel.
Looking back on the course, it is heavily padded. Weeks 2 and 3 either cover concepts that are not directly used in the PCA algorithm, or which are rehashes of material from the previous two courses. Students could theoretically learn about PCA simply by applying previously taught concepts about projections and eigenvectors to the covariance matrix introduced in week 1. Four weeks of material are simply not justified.

PCA is not a difficult concept to wrap your head around if you have some understanding of linear algebra and basic data science. The previous courses made linear algebra and multivariate calculus approachable, practical, and fun. This course, on the other hand, is overcomplicated, light on useful material, artificially difficult, and made me want to pull out my hair.",1

However, the course is quite buggy and needs a mayor overhaul. Quizzes in the videos have no answers, the practial assignments have quite some bugs - outside the code, we are supposed to edit.
Fixes for these bugs can found in the forums or - given enough Python and NumPy knowledge - be fixed by one self. Yet the instructors do not fix these once and for all. To me this seems lazy and I expect more from a course that is paid for and has an audience that is mostly doing this during afterhours and wants to learn something about PCA and not on how to find workarounds to please the AutoGrader.

However, the way it was taught was ineffective for learning (to me personally and I suspect to many others as well) regardless of our different backgrounds or lack of strong math skills. 
Although the concept of PCA is rather simple, its computations and the interpretations & meanings of each transformation are challenging without examples and visualizations. We did have some examples in the course, but not detailed and complete enough to fully understand PCA intuitively and thoroughly. 
One ended up spending huge amount of time reading additional relevant articles on internet, fishing out useful information from Discussion Forums,  yet still struggling a great deal to write codes for completing assignments. Even though the codes run through without returning mistakes and one gets ""pass"", there is not much satisfaction and joy one feels in learning because sometimes, the initial learning from listening to the lectures was so insufficient and inadequate for doing the assignment that one simply completes the task doing all one can without further understanding and solidification of the knowledge. 
This feeling is in such a huge contrast to those when learning the two other related courses in the Specialization (Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus) during which one enjoyed immensely the learning process as well as the content. Here I do not think that one can attribute the difference to the seemingly higher level of difficulty of PCA. The instructors for those two courses did an excellent job to explain things intuitively and thoroughly. 
Marc is an extremely knowledgeable and competent professional. By changing the teaching style more in tune with the learners, I am sure more people will learn a great deal from this course and enjoy the learning process in the meantime.

The lecturer shows no passion to the subject whatsoever and spends all the time writing out monstrous formal definitions instead of trying to build student's intuition of what things really mean.

2) Lecturer wastes his _super precious_ time by multiplying matrices by hand. Screw it. I'm also lecturer at university and from my experience such demo should be done once/twice. And after that, guys, matrix operations in numpy have to be demonstrated in the class, otherwise practical exercises could be done only by those with solid prior experience in Python + NumPy
3) Quality of practical assignments is below any critics. Some cannot work at Coursera platform, they should be run locally and to run Jupiter Notebook locally one has to be seasoned Python programmer and good DevOps. Guidelines to practical assignments do not guide at all. SW practices in assignments are dubious.
Bottom line: kindly advice to develop two courses - overview for those without linear algebra  knowledge at all, and normal one - focused on Week 4 material. Coursera format with 5 minute lectures cannot accommodate such course? Leave this platform, Marc Peter is great lecturer and specialist, his name should not be associated with such failure.

9613,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Amar D N,"May 30, 2020","I have already completed this course but i felt like i needed to share my frustration regarding this 3rd course of the specialization. First of all, the previous two courses were excellent! I am not judging based on difficulty, those two courses opened my eyes on linear algebra and calculus. But this 'PCA' one is utterly disappointing. It revisited some theories of the previous courses in such a bad way.
If most of the things need to be learnt through the reading materials then is it justified to do this course? I mean I can find even better reading materials on the web. The only reason i kept on going is to go through the PCA portion of week 4. All topics of previous weeks were already covered by me that's why i didn't have to struggle much. But the explanations were quite inadequate and proofs of the theorems felt like rushed. I somehow managed to reach the final assignment and then my real frustration began. The grader was giving inappropriate results, submitting my code gave me 2/3 out of 10. after resubmitting with the same code multiple times, I finally passed the assignment. Won't recommend this course to anyone. ",1
9614,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Paul,"Aug 5, 2020","The lecturer doesn't provide us with adequate information to connect all materials together. Much knowledge in lectures are not enough or unrelated to completing programming homework or tests. In one of the programming assignment, the guidance is misleading and I believe most of us reached out for help in forum to finish the assignment. 
In week one, everything looks pretty simple but the question and lectures are kind of unclear. Everything then goes worse in week two. the programming assignment is a nightmare. If you are familiar with python, you may only spend hours to complete this. Otherwiese you may have to struggle between unclear guidance, bugs and python syntax. Week three is not so bad but a lot of resource are from wikipedia with little illustration. Week four is jammed with auxiliary materials and massive critical PCA knowledge with limited explanation. I simply feel I was fooled to enroll in this course.",1

You are warned at the beginning that this course is challenging. This is true, but there is absolutely no reason why it should be THIS challenging. There are several factors that make this course more difficult than it needs to be. The poor pacing leads to a bizarre mix of repetitive trivial questions and vague assignments with poor explanation and over-reliance on reading external sources. Nobody wants constant hand-holding but the lack of direction will lead to you wasting far too much time chasing down minor technical errors and figuring out what on earth is being asked of you. Finishing this course was a slog and I just wanted to wash my hands of it. The first two courses in this specialisation are great and I highly recommend them, but I would not be happy if I had paid £38 for this course.  ",1

The programming assignments are more about numpy/python peculiarities (which dimension is D or N) and deciphering cryptographic specifications (X is documented as an input but not a parameter to the function). The misleading templates appear to be intentional - it is not clear what educational purpose this serves. The difficulty in this course is not conceptual understanding - it is difficult because the assignments are intentionally confusing. Another point regarding programming in general. This course prefers implementing numerous functions (no testing), generating large amounts of random data as input, and assuming all goes well. Perhaps each function should be tested for correctness individually with known input/output - this is not a novel idea.",1

Thank you, Marc. Your explanations combined with the book ""Mathematics for Machine Learning"" have come really handy. 
It has been an amazing journey to see how linear algebra marries multivariate calculus to give birth to to PCA. 
Being a linguist, I must admit I'm quite new to Python and the domain of machine learning. It would be great if you could add some polishing touches to the programming assignments, especially the one in Week 4 (PCA): waiting for a long time until the system finishes crunching the code was quite a slow experience. If that has to do with a student's sloppy code, please add some recommendations inside the assignment on how to avoid this trap. If that is caused by some technical issues on the server side, please take a moment to look at this.
That you have added the Python tutorial is really helpful. Could you also consider updating it with some details on how to sort eigenvectors and eigenvalues to collect these into a covariance matrix. This piece was mighty tough.

The main problem is with the assignments - for some weeks there's not enough guidance about what the functions should be returning, so these should be better documented; the other issue is that some of the code that we are not required to edit doesn't actually work - for instance, my implementation of PCA passed the grader but the visualisations in the week 4 notebook didn't work.

·      
Instead of video lectures students are
repeatedly sent to Wikipedia or similar
·      
The lecturer’s 417-page text was available, but
without worked examples and no reference between lecture material and text
·      
Examples on the videos often skipped steps
·      
Often the videos did not have enough information
to do the quizzes
·      
The instructor has not been on the discussion
forum for 16 months
·      
Uninspiring assignments (and laughably low
estimated times to complete)
·      
Intermediate level Python is required, but not
mentioned as a prerequisite
I know that ‘style’ is subjective, but the institution
(Imperial College London) and Coursera really should have given the lecturer
some training on how to appear to enjoy teaching.  Personally I would not want to attend this
school for fear of being stuck with this lecturer for a semester.
The negativity of this review is unfortunate since Principal
Component Analysis is an important and popular concept in statistics, math and
machine learning. I hope this course is replaced in the near future. In the

Sometimes he would reference a property of matrices that were not talked about, and I would have to spend half an hour researching what that property was to follow what was happening. The quizzes were minimally helpful, as they were merely the same computation question repeated throughout the quiz, which does not help to build intuitive understanding. The programming assignments are unclear on instructions and had many bugs, even in the pre-written parts. A lot of time was spent on reading the NumPy documentation, as the assignments gave little indication of what functions should be used and how they should be used.

Such as only asking to normalize by centering on the mean, not dividing by the standard deviation. However, further down the exercise it mentions mean and standard deviation....

9681,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Pradeep K,"Apr 30, 2020","Very Poor course on PCA, My recommendation. Don't watch it, Please don't waste your money on it.
Reasons:
1) The course on algebra and calculus was intuitive geometrically and well taught. Here the instructor bothered only doing derivations. No intuition based thinking, no analogy to real world. Just plain hard notations.
2) I don't think even the instructor would understand what was taught in the course. The excercises were completely unrelated to what was taught. Not much given examples. The examples choosen uses values like 0,1,2. Why can't you pick some odd numbers to make it bit more non confusion and clear. 
3) At the end there was a review /  Survey for every course. The review for this course is disabled. Clearly everyone knows how bad this is. Remove this course or make it better that is what the recommendation. There is no provision for zero stars, Had there one I would not given that also. 
Really frustrated with the PCA course. Please don't waste your time and money . Get Gilbert Strang's book. That will do justice for every penny. I was able to complete the course, All thanks to Gilbert's book on Linear Algebra. Thanks",1
9682,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Ivan F G,"Jul 1, 2020","The technical issues with Jupyter Notebooks really made me waste too many days, a lot of my time not learning but just fighting a poorly implemented exercise.  And the technical issues did not help the teacher, the notebooks had a role to give us a place to learn new concepts that he mentioned in the fly, but there were no small sets of data to test the functions.  I wasn't very patient with the way he will say things like ""this is the formula from the previous video"", and show a different formula from what he had on the previous video. Really? Why making things obscure on purpose? You can just have said, we had our previous formula and them used properties of the transpose of a product to get this other formula. Please make an effort to redo the notebooks. Even better, do some of the examples in Phyton during class for what you do in paper, and then let us take those examples and make a general function on the notebooks. Give smaller databases, something easy to plot and test, without waiting 20+minutes to have a result.",1
9683,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Anurag G,"Sep 13, 2020","I started this course with lots of enthusiasm since the previous two courses were exceptionally well structured and helpful, but I can not compare this course with those two.
The biggest problem for me was that Programming assignments are not well written and most of the time beyond the course material shared. It challenges your previous skills and may hit your self-confidence. 
There are also few mistakes or/and skipped steps in the video, and they make progress little tricky. 
My classmates were very helpful, and I would suggest relying more on the forums than video lectures when you need help. I would not recommend this course at all to anyone, but if you have done the first two, may complete the last one to complete the specialization. 
Also, the first two courses are a few of the best certificates that I did on Machine Learning, and I have done six other mathematics for machine learning, currently enrolled for a degree course in Data Science.

9684,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Diego M E,"Apr 3, 2021","This course by no means retains the quality of its two predecessors. The difficulty of the programming assignments simply does not match that of what you watch in the videos and have to face in the practice quizzes. You need to have at the very least an intermediate understanding of both python and numpy. It should be stated somewhere that, if you really want to try and complete the assignments with a passing grade you'd need to invest **a lot** of your time. The course does not even remotely give you the tools necessary to complete these assignments; you'll need to research on your own and consult forums, videos, manuals, etc. My advice would be to learn python to an intermediate level first, then really practice with numpy, and just after that take this course. Otherwise you'll probably get very frustrated and quit.",1

The majority of lectures are no more that the lecturer reading our a formula parrot-fashion  onto the screen, he makes no effort to make the subject informative or explain what is going on. In many cases, he doesn't even bother creating a lecture, he simply posts a link to Wikipedia.
Lectures, quizzes and assignments are littered with bugs and omissions.

So, I found myself lost on the quiz and programming assignments. I am quitting the course even if I paid for it, since I feel is it not being a good use of my time.

complete lack of participation of staff in maintaining it. This leads to students giving each other incorrect advice and sharing incorrect code which passes the grader function check ( the grades are assigned automatically). The advice students give each other are frankly so wrong it is shocking.
the teacher focuses on formalised proof rather than concepts. Hence the lectures turn into lecturer applying mathematical transfomations which end in a formal argument without any intuitive understanding of the underlying subject.

It is hard though and in the weeks 3 and 4 I had to pause and rewind almost every 10 seconds of the videos and search some error in code labs on the web. But in the end this course showed me in great detail the process of PCA and I also learned a bit of linear algebra alongside it. Considering problems with this course, there were some points that got me a little bit dissapointed. I still don't get it why are we using the biased version of variance, sometimes the notation changed a little bit, (which is not a big problem but introduces some inconvience if the material is completely new to the learner), some of the math concepts were not covered in the ""linear algebra"" course.

9701,Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA by Imperial College London,Marco v Z,"Jul 19, 2020","I was somewhat put off by critical comments about the third course in this series, but have to disagree with the reviewers. Yes, it is tougher and, yes, the instructor doesn't have the ""schwung"" of the other two instructors, but that doesn't affect the quality of this course. His walkthrough of the derivation of PCA is thorough and systematic, and builds on material that has been presented in the earlier lectures.
In fact, looking back on the entire specialisation, I would retrospectively grade the first two courses a notch lower (even if they're excellent), simply because they ""sailed through"" a bit too easily. The exercises in those courses required little thinking apart from recalling what was said in the lectures. In this course, exercises tended to go beyond or ahead of the material presented in the lectures. Solving them required active thinking, reading, and problem solving, which in the end brings a more thorough understanding.",5

- Statistical Learning of Datasets
- Linear Algebra of Transformations: Orthogonal Projections, Inner Products in Finite Dimensions
- Analysis of Covariance Matrix
- PCA Algorithm via a constrained minimization problem.
There are also studied some applications:
1. Numpy Programming
2. KNN algorithm
3. Classification, Logistic Regression
4. Encoding and Decoding Information
The course and whole specialisation is suitable for people who have a solid mathematical background because some of theories are provided in a review, given that other mathematics courses have been studied. The main goal is to formulate the PCA algorithm and related topics. This is a master of Linear Algebra in Data Processing.

When  you teach students how to evaluate the conditions required for certain methods, but then walk through those methods even when the conditions aren't met, you reinforce poor practice. If you want to use an example where the conditions aren't met, STOP once you find out the conditions aren't met. STOP and REINFORCE the fact that you cannot use a method without meeting conditions. It is not a valuable exercise to walk through the plug and chug calculations anyway. STOP, discuss why you can't proceed, and then move on to another example if you want to give your students an opportunity to practice taking the method through to its conclusion. ",2
9745,Inferential Statistics by Duke University,Ian,"Feb 7, 2018","The course did teach statistics but there were some problems with R commands, assignment expectations and grading outcomes. For one, this course really needs to do a better job of emphasizing that the student is expected to use R commands provided by Course 1 (I think it's called ""Exploring Data"") as well as this one. It would be helpful if students had easy access to all of the labs in that course as well as this one. Secondly, the list of expectations given out for the final project omitted several requirements (apparently we are expected to use R commands learned) though this is a small problem. 
The biggest problem is the peer-grading. Reviewing other peers was actually very helpful in that it does teach you about your mistakes. For example, I realized after grading others that I had made two major errors and was ready to redo my project if needed or, if I passed, never make those types of errors again. This feeling that you are learning and that this is a quality course is taken away when your grade doesn't match your work. In my case, I got a perfect score which is nonsense. Like I said I made two big mistakes one of which was not including a confidence interval when I should have. What if I made others that I didn't see? 
Feedback is important. It is a big part of learning. So is the ability to actually use the skills being taught (the R commands were taught much less clearly than say in Datacamp which this course suggests we use even though it is NOT free and I signed up for the Duke course specifically because it taught statistics using R). It's a good course overall and you will learn statistics; but when you're charging people a fairly high monthly fee, you should deliver on your promises to give feedback and to effectively teach one of the major course goals.",3

9748,Inferential Statistics by Duke University,Diego R G,"May 26, 2019","A very good introduction to the fundamentals of inference and NHST.

Also, the course won't provide a lot of information on how to use R, but if you spend a good amount of time on your project and make sure that it's good you will learn enough. I had to review a lot of R projects that were not very good, which suggests that some students aren't learning what they should.
If you want to learn statistics or have limited knowledge on the topic, and also want to learn a bit about how to use R, take the course. If you already know statistics and you only want to learn R, then this might not be the course for you, as the emphasis is on statistics per se.  ",5

Likewise, I saw one comment where the student mentioned how they got confused by a core concept (p-value) and could finally wrap their head around it by watching a Khan Academy video. And sadly, this was also endorsed by a mentor. Overall, I found the effort put into this course insufficient for people who are new to Statistics or R. Therefore, the name of the entire specialization becomes misleading as it suggests that we were going to be taught how to use R in statistics. I had high hopes for this course but sadly I will abandon it and spend my money on an alternative course/specialization.",2

Personally, I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics (simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course). The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window... 
If you're new to statistics, I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided...   ",2
9757,Inferential Statistics by Duke University,Rachel P,"Jun 12, 2020","This is my second course of the specialization. Took this course as I thought it would be beneficial for my work as a research assistant. I have taken basic statistics for life science before back as an undergraduate and did not have any programming background prior to taking the courses from Duke. 
So far, I am able to follow through the weeks. Would say that it's rather intense compared to the first course (Introduction to Probability and Data with R) in terms of content. The course is rather insightful and really enjoyed it overall despite the painful hours spent after work. The lecturer is really clear in her explanation. Would really recommend everyone who takes this course with little prior knowledge on stats to do the readings and exercises in the resource book on top of the video lectures. This helps to clear doubts on our side and enables the concepts to be reinforced and sink in our head better.
As for the lab sessions. I would say a lot of googling and figuring things out on my side was required, especially when doing the projects. Sometimes the forum does help. However, I would say the involvement of the mentors for this course is slightly lower than that in the previous course. That said, most of the issues encountered when doing the 'hands on' in R can be found in google.
I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested to learn data analysis with R. ",5

For example, in talking about F test statistics, it was difficult to understand the reasoning behind F = variance between groups / variance within groups until I had to look up other explanations elsewhere. While I believe that the instructor teaches well in most parts, I often find it difficult to follow along because she goes through a lot of assumptions and I'm unclear as how / why she is allowed to go on her assumptions.",3
9761,Inferential Statistics by Duke University,Reuben A,"May 5, 2020",It has skills I need to learn for work using R programming.  The instructor for me is hard to follow and squeezes way too much into verbally explaining things in such detail before you comprehend what she has said while at the same time presenting information on the slide incrementally.  This leads to me not being able to choose to listen to her or ignore the slide.  Maybe you are better at multitasking in real time.  With that said you can tell she puts lots of energy into the video and makes things relevant.  If you take these courses READ FIRST then watch the videos and be ready to click the pause button so you don't miss a concept that vanishes to the next slide in a few seconds.,3

I rated the course low though because of the incorporation of R.  I reviewed every lab in detail in attempting to create the final project, and most of what I needed was never covered. Also, R is constantly changing so the coding in the examples no longer works and it's almost impossible to find a course that is up to date on all codes (for example, the select() function does not work, nor does %>% in the downloaded R or R Studio.  It's beyond frustrating. The two-hour final project took 14 hours.

The weekly labs went over a few R-based scenarios, but did not provide enough examples or a broad enough overview to prepare students to use the program effectively if they were not already familiar with the program.

I'm sure she has a great depth of knowledge and grateful that she's able to deliver her knowledge out to listeners. She uses meaningful examples all along the course, no dry pure mathematical cases at all. That helps a ton to digest concepts. And she constantly repeat some core concepts and how to interpret a statistic right. I didn't realize how important this was until I was challenged with questions, then I came back and hear again her interpretation, and the whole thing became clearer. She's one of the best professors I've ever listened to, and I've been through grad school, met so many professors. 
The current mentor Rolf was great at supporting. He answers a lot of questions in the forum. He's very responsible and supportive. So if you're considering on taking this course, take it now as mentor will change!
I haven't finished the course yet, but the enrollment rate seems to be quite decent, so I wouldn't expect it to take too long to get final project reviewed and get certificate. I assume this is an important issue for any course takers. 
The only downside is that there could be more R code teaching, especially on complicated simulations. That way it may be more friendly to R beginners. I know it's important to do research ourselves for codes, but beginners could lack of proper terminology or vision by nature to do the research on Google. Especially when I'm physically in the Main Land of China, where it takes some efforts to even get on Google, so doing code research took a lot of my time and was a little frustrating towards the end. 
But again, the overall course and support are great! If this is not a 5 start course, I can hardly give out my highest mark to any other courses. It helped me to understand inferencial statistics, practice R, and think more like a statistician. ",5

Course Structure: The course structure is well organized with clear focus in each week. 
The first and second weeks are easy to follow, but the third and fourth weeks are more challenging.
Textbook: The textbook used in this course is a good supplementary material, although it is not necessary to read the textbook. Course videos have already explained everything that we need to know at intro level. However, it is worth reading the textbook for the third and fourth weeks.

9870,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,David C B,"Feb 10, 2017","Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling.  This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",3
9871,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Paul N,"Jun 9, 2018",I got the sense that this course needs to be updated. Some of the quizzes covered work that had not been treated up to that point and the programming assignment did not work with the most recent version of the MeTA toolkit. For a course of this stature I would have expected a lot more attention to such detail. It would also appear as though the owners of the course material are not present on the forums with students left to their own devices.This course as well as the Text Retrieval one does not compare well with the Machine Learning course from Stanford offered on Coursera when considering the above issues.Some work is required I believe,3
9872,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Essam D,"Aug 26, 2016",The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.,1
9873,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Sawal M,"Apr 18, 2017","I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course.",3
9874,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,象道,"Jan 1, 2017","This course is a pretty good resource for full-time graduates who are doing research in Natural Language Processing, but not for other people who want to learn in part-time some concrete skills to resolve specific text mining problems.
The course-style is heuristic-guiding based. Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found. So, some text books had better be specified.
Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task. It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content. As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.
This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail. However, this course could be designed and organized better.",3

It's very hard to explain text mining just in 6 weeks course. But Professor did it. I hope professor can provide further class of text mining, provide more detail case to explain some algorithm not covering in this class and cover more new topic like knowledge graph etc.",5
9877,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Gary C,"Jul 25, 2017",The content of the course is quite good. Professor Cheng explains the concepts well and I did learn quite a bit. However I feel that these courses have been all but abandoned by any support personnel. So far this is not a series I would recommend for anything but watching video lectures.,3
9878,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,John,"Feb 7, 2018","The topics were interesting and Cheng was very motivated.
But often I found I didn't understand why we were spending a lot of time with the explanation of one thing and very little on another one. E.g., Bayes theorem was intensively discussed when Cheng explained the Naive Bayes Model, but the theorem had been heavily used prior to that. The concept of ""Mixture Model"" was asked about several times in tests, but I couldn't remember whether it had been defined. K-NN was subject of the exam before it had been handled in the course. I found the explanation of CPLSA wasn't enough for understanding its mechanics. Personally, I would have liked to understand LDA better.
Notwithstanding, thank you for this course!",2

9886,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,geoffrey a,"Sep 7, 2017","This is a great course for data science.  I hope to use many of the techniques that were explained.  There is plenty of cutting edge material here.  It is essential for modern data science practice in my opinion. It's fairly advanced level.  Students of this course will do just fine though, if they already have the ability to pass university level undergraduate computer science courses.
It would be a better course if the MOOC students received more attention from the teaching staff.  The participation rate in the forums by students as well as staff was pretty low.  As such it requires a strong and independent student to pass this course. It would also be a better course if there were more coding homeworks using something like jupyter notebooks.  Also I would make the course a few more weeks long to handle the extra homework which I am suggesting.
This is probably the best MOOC course on this material in existence, to my knowledge.  Highly recommend this course for anyone who intends to be a data science practitioner.",4

Definitely read the additional resources for the material - it will give you an incredibly in-depth view to what you learned in the lectures and also give you a start on implementing the covered algorithms on your own.
The only thing I missed in this class are assignments for implementing the algorithms in a language other than C++ and in a framework other than MeTA. It would make sense to provide this opportunity in additional, commonly-used data-science languages such as Python!",4
9969,Text Mining and Analytics by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Milan M,"Sep 15, 2016","This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts. 
I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course: 
1) Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them.

10031,Apache Spark (TM) SQL for Data Analysts by Databricks,Nate F,"Feb 20, 2022","It's okay. Biggest issue I had were the mistakes. Questions would have the wrong code, as in the question would ask to limit the data by year and month but each answer was limited by month and day. There is one instance where the entire work through won't execute unless the data file is renamed in each code chunk. Plenty of spelling errors. The subtitles for the videos have errors, at one point it states ""inaudible"" when the speaker is clearly talking. The course looks to have been posted a year ago and it is unfortunate that such simple mistakes haven't been fixed yet. It is true that you don't need much (or any) experience with SQL to understand the material which makes it excellent as an introductory course. Another participant talked about rejoining the course after a few months break and no longer had access to the free community edition of the software, another responded that the community edition is only a 14 day trial (of a 9 week course).

* The questions for quizzes and exercises were written by someone that is not fluent in English -- you will waste a LOT of time digging through the forums where other students had to piece together the intended meaning.

H,"Sep 21, 2021","This course does a very poor job of actually teaching the concepts presented in it. There is a lot of ""copy/paste"" instruction, with almost no explanation of what is being done or why, at either the technical level (i.e. why are calling this function or method) or a the theoretical level (i.e. why a visualization or data interaction is useful).  It does touch on a many basic foundation for interacting with data (which is the only reason I'm not giving it 1 star), but from an actual instruction perspective, this the worst courses I have finished on Coursera.

However, it definitely needs updating. There are times where assignment instructions are incomplete, or there are discrepancies between what is shown in the lecture and what is in the notebooks. There are also times where what is in the assignment quizzes doesn't match up with the actual data in the assignment notebooks.
I didn't get a lot out of some of the weeks, as it felt like the instructor was just reading word for word what was written in the notebooks, not adding any additional commentary or explanation. Furthermore, I wish they would have dove deeper into some of the statistics and math behind some of the concepts they showed. They would introduce a concept a lot of times, but not explain what it meant or how it related to other concepts we had learned.",2

I also threatened to call it out in my course review if it wasn't rewritten for clarity & I am an extremely petty person.
 Other than that this is an absolutely fantastic course for people with limited Excel experience like myself. The lectures are all good length and skills are build upon each other in a nice logical way. The quizzes (sans week 3 question 2 & a few other questions that could be rewritten for better clarity) are well designed & actually help with developing the skills instead of just asking you to regurgitate facts from the lectures.

I had to google further info to resolve the questions. My suggestion is: add more info on the course with much more details (equal to the assignments given) or give a simple assignment question. Also, the questions in the assignment are not very clear and well explained, you feel that you have not really watched the video - although when you try to redo all the excels as per on the videos I really do them quickly.

It didn't go into too much detail on formatting and some other functions, since I think its intended to set you up for statistics specifically, but it was an excellent class nonetheless. The files and PowerPoint slides were well-done; for example, unlike some other Excel courses I've taken on Coursera, the PowerPoint slides are explanatory and clear, the text is big enough to be able to take screenshots of for note-taking purposes, and the quiz and test questions are clearly worded. Sharad also is a very good lecturer- engaging and doesn't rush through things; rather, he reminds you of things throughout the course, rather than just mentioning them once and then never explaining it again and assuming you remember it.",5

10292,Introduction to Data Analysis Using Excel by Rice University,Richie P,"Apr 24, 2023","While the quizzes were helpful, I felt a bit uncomfortable. This made it to feel a bit harmful to a person's psychological well being. The structure was developmental in that the course built upon itself and each question required knowledge from previous course material. However, some questions were so briefly addressed that I felt a bit crazy trying to understand where or when this material was ever covered. 
Anyone with ADHD may have trouble with the quizzes. Although, it may be helpful to them in that it gives them an opportunity to focus in their studies and career advancement. Yet, if the attention deficits arise from repeated childhood trauma, I see no good in this approach. Essentially, the course is isolating in various small but influential ways.
With the accessibility of this course to poverty stricken, I could imagine the numbers of people with childhood trauma to be high. Approach the course with caution. Forums showed a similar type of distress and were equally distasteful. 
Otherwise, the course was very informative. It was delivered in manageable weekly sessions. The data practice was relevant and pertinent to a diverse group of individuals.

I am an experienced xlsx user and was taking this course only to understand what the focus was on for subsequent courses, and 
I was interested in doing the overall specialization as the syllabus fits my interests very much",1

Anyone who has little to no familiarity with pivot tables, lookup functions, and basic mathematics calculations would definitely benefit from the course. The instructor is very thorough. I consider myself an advanced user and found a few of the end-lesson testing questions to have a good level of challenge to them considering the lessons at hand. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone needing to learn Excel for data manipulation. The support from the instructors was excellent: prompt and helpful.

This course is great for someone who is not acquainted with the functions COUNTIF, SUMIF, VLOOKUPS, HLOOKUPS, Pivot Tables and Charts. It provides the fundamentals and teaches the main idea behind using these functions and features. The delivery was very lucid. The pace was fine as well. The assignments really helped to brush up on the skills which was really necessary. Whatever issues/bugs/doubts I faced I could easily resolve it referring to the discussion forums. 
Also,  I have to say the content is very engaging as this is the first course I could actually complete online and earn a certificate. So, highly recommended for someone who is not used to learning online!",5

I also enjoyed the quizzes at the end of each week because it helps you solidify the knowledge you gained in a very practical way. This is a great course especially if you need to revise VLookUp, HLookUp, Pivot Tables, Charts, and Data Analysis.

10301,Introduction to Data Analysis Using Excel by Rice University,Abdul H b A Y,"Sep 5, 2020","Good course for the basics, learned a lot about pivot tables and I am excited to apply it to my projects.
Some comments on the quizzes;
1) Week 1 Graded Quiz there was a question on the unit price of the last row, which I got wrong. I am pretty sure the answer is correct. Would love feedback on this.
2) Week 2 Graded Quiz there was a question on the quantity of orders made in one quarter but shipped in the next. I found some orders made in Q4 but received in Q1, so this might not make much sense. Also I got this wrong, and I think that it should be right (add up three numbers from the pivot table). Would also love feedback on this.

10375,Business Analysis Process by Tableau Learning Partner,Khairunnisa N,"Jan 18, 2024","I found the guiding tutorials in this Tableau course very helpful, but I think some complex topics would benefit greatly from additional video explanations. Watching an instructor visually demonstrate these steps or seeing an interactive video walkthrough could significantly improve understanding and retention, especially for learners who prefer a visual learning style. Of course, I understand that adding video content might have resource constraints, but I believe it would significantly enhance the overall learning experience.",4
10376,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Diego R G,"May 27, 2019","It's a very good course for starting to learn about linear regression. Just be aware that the quality of this course is a bit lower than the previous two. There are fewer videos, the book material is shorter (less suggested exercises and the chapters cover fewer things about linear regression) and some quiz exercises of week 2, which should only cover simple linear regression, have some questions about multiple linear regression which is the 3rd week's topic. 
Also, as in the previous two courses, the emphasis is on statistics, not programming with R. This means that if you already know statistics and only want to learn how to use R, there are probably better courses out there for you. But if you want to learn or improve your knowledge of statistics, and also learn how to use R, then do take this course. I think that it's much better to start learning R by actually doing some statistical work and seeing first hand what the software is capable of doing with only a few lines of code, even if you don't fully understand the code's syntax at first.
With all that said, if you take the course PAY ATTENTION TO THE LECTURES, READ THE CHAPTERS and DO THE SUGGESTED EXERCISES. I can't stress this enough. If you don't do all of that, you won't learn as much as you should, and it's painfully obvious that some students didn't do all of that when you review their final R projects. Also, take your time with that final project because that's where you will actually learn some things about R and use what you have learned about statistics (you will have to use google to learn how to code some things properly).",4
10377,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Mindaugas Ž,"Jan 8, 2019","The course is good regarding concepts and theoretical exercises, but poor regarding applying new knowledge in R. Since the course is introductory, an instruction how to install R and a list of R functions without clear explanation how they should be applied in general regression situations makes me explore other sources to learn how to apply those concepts (e.g. DataCamp, CRAN-RProject, etc) and then get back to learn theory? Sorry for expectations but course should provide a full and integrated package of knowledge and skills, especially for beginners. 
Furthermore, no Machine Learning (ML) is covered as a tool to run a regression. 
My proposal is to provide an algorithm with a comprehensive example how to run a regression using R. From data to final model, step-by-step.",3
10378,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Assaf B,"Mar 15, 2018","The mathematical depth of this course, is insufficient even at its targeted level, and therefore a lot of practical manipulations of the data, and fine tuning of the model could be had if a week more has been put into this course.
Easy does not equate fun, after completing this course, I left the specialization.",3
10379,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Y. N,"Jan 16, 2023","The course is great and I got the certificate for finishing the specialization. I'm a bit sad though. 
There used to be a 4-th and a capstone course in this specialization, but they removed them from the requirements. The courses used to be a bit more difficult with a final project, they made them optional too.
I really hope they can improve the course content instead of removing things. The sense of achievement drops greatly knowing the courses get watered down in difficulty.",5
10380,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Omar K,"Sep 23, 2016",Very good course. while it does not cover everything. the teacher does a great job explaining things in a simple manner. My feed back would be to move ANOVA into this module. ,5

The dataset was full of characteristics that were explicitly not covered in the course.  I had to do a ton of outside research in order to complete the project and understand what I was doing.
Additionally, the forums are completely unhelpful.  I never got a reply to any of my questions, and saw many other unanswered questions while browsing.  ",4
10388,Linear Regression and Modeling by Duke University,Σταυρος Β,"Jan 17, 2022","Very good course and material overall - although a little lighter in content compared to the previous one (Inferential Statistics).

10501,"Geospatial Analysis with ArcGIS by University of California, Davis",Pete J,"Nov 3, 2023","I began the GIS specialization in July 2023 at which time ArcGIS Desktop was the software that learners were provided in course 1 (Fundamentals of GIS). The specialization was revamped in October 2023 and I was given the option of continuing with the ""old"" specialization or moving to the revamped specialization, where the first two courses in the specialization were still applicable and counted toward completion of the specialization. I of course went with the newer specialization since the older material is becoming obsolete. 

The problem with the retooling of the specialization is that ArcGIS Pro is the software used in the new course material but no license has been made available to the learners who started with ArcGIS Desktop. Going back to the material for Fundamentals of GIS, I am only able to access the old material which doesn't offer the option of acquiring Pro. If you are a brand new learner then you get the new material and can download Pro. Many other learners are having this same problem, we've posted about it in the discussion forums several times, and the instructor - Eric Howard - does not engage in the the discussion because learners are supposed to help each other solve their problems. I get that but this is a content problem where resolution will need to come from course staff. I've engaged with many Coursera staff hoping this problem can be ultimately be addressed by UC DAvis but we just go in circles, where I am told to keep posting in the discussion forums to MIA course staff. Coursera staff also point me to the old material in Fundamentals that I already used for getting Desktop. The Coursera staff are speedy and professional in their communications but aren't able to offer any actual solutions or progress toward getting a Pro license. So, after all this, I have had to use a colleague's account to access Pro and move forward with the course content.

Additionally, the presentation quality of the instructor videos has really gone downhill from the first two courses in the specialization. Nick Santos did a fantastic job clearly presenting the material in a professional and engaging manner. In contrast, Mr. Howard uses linguistic fillers throughout his speech: kinda like/kind of like, actually. It's annoyingly distracting. The videos appear to have been recorded at his residence and you can hear a young child crying in the background at various times. Some of the prompts in the discussion forum are in the wrong places. For example, learners are asked in week 1 what they learned from the course and if it fullfilled their expectations. One of the data fies that is provided is corrupted and will not download.

Overall, I'm very disappointed with my experience in Geospatial Analysis with ArcGIS. UC Davis needs to remedy these problems.",1
10502,"Geospatial Analysis with ArcGIS by University of California, Davis",Tarren G,"Nov 30, 2023","Instructor needs to work on his audio setup as well as avoiding filler words such as ""kinda"", ""like"", or ""uh"" in every video as it impedes on understanding the material when it sounds like even he isn't sure about what he is saying.",3

Very disappointing class.  There are Youtube tutorials out there with more content than this class.  This is one of the only classes that I have ever taken on Coursera where  I could complete 2 weeks worth of all the lectures, assignments, and quizzes in a Sunday afternoon.  I think this class was hastily slapped together, there is so little content.  If your organization uses Spark and is not a Databricks client (as mine is), you will learn absolutely nothing here.  The lectures are extremely short and devoid of any substance.  I am still looking for a good online class in Spark.  It certainly is not this one.",1
10511,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Sacha v W,"Feb 19, 2020",very superficial using databricks. The courses misses depth to be of any use. It is more a Databricks commercial. Executing pieces of available course without sufficient practice,2
10512,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Alex C,"May 27, 2020","it was an interesting course in as much as it has got me interested in spark and it was doable. I think it tried to cover too much ground in not enough depth. After completing I have gone off and am doing the datacamp spark courses which are also interesting. 
The implementation stuff in databricks was really annoying in that the platform used a ´´ whatever it actually was - i still dont know!!!! i just had to copy and paste it every time...it was never mentioned that it didnt work like sql with [] or that it wasnt a apostrophe or whatever. 
The use of jupyter notebooks itself was nice, and the exercises were also nice as a learning exercise, i got a lot out of them by having to actually find out some things and see ah ha thats how it works. 
The presenters were very good. I could be critical of a few points but i wont as i am guessing its there first mooc or so, and my personal opinions are irrelevant in my annoyances :-) 
All in all a nice course as it has good me interested and actually up and running with spark, so i can see where and how it fits and will look further...

10513,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Bryan B,"Jul 6, 2020","The first module felt more like a sales pitch for DataBricks than anything else, and the last module was about machine learning, and not distributed computing. So, in my opinion, only 2 of the weeks attempted to focus on distributed computing, but even they failed. The course seemed to focus way more on SQL, and less on Spark and how it works. Sure, there were pieces of information on how to how to change the number of partitions, but how partitions work, or how Spark actually handles distributed computing was lackluster at best. If you have even a rudimentary understanding of data engineering, you should be able to ace this course with minimal effort, but you'll likely not take much away from it. Great course for absolute beginners though.",2

10621,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Fabian E P C,"Sep 13, 2022","This is the worst specialization I have taken so far on Coursera, and I have taken several, either from universities or private companies.
 The first course is fine for someone who already has SQL knowledge and just needs a refresher, but it is still a course with zero depth in the use of SQL in data science. It is just slides, better explanations of SQL can be found on YouTube.
The second course shows an interesting use of SQL, which is not normally covered. But the structure, assessments, assignments and final project are very open and ambiguous. The explanations are superfluous and you can tell that the course was made in a hurry, with no attention to details and with deficiencies in teaching.
Perhaps the third course is the best, as they present a useful technology and platform.
The final project is a total disappointment, as it is not focused on SQL and its use in Data Science activities, the videos are largely a recycling of those seen in previous courses, so that SQL, which is what the specialization is about, you do not learn something new or have the opportunity to apply it as it really applies in Data Science. Better SQL projects are found on YouTube, but these do not give a certificate endorsed by an educational institution such as the University of California, Davis. Sad that the readings in week four are links to other courses, they did not bother to create material or even reference it in a better way.
 Zero material is shared. 
After this experience I think I will not take any other course or specialization of this University, as well as not recommend it, I finished it just to receive the certificate, but I think it is not worth spending time on it.",4
10622,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Justin M,"Mar 16, 2021","I liked how the instructors delivered material; their videos were informative and easy to follow, and they did a good job. The assignments were fine, especially the quizzes. I got a good sense of why distributed computing is useful and how to do it in spark.
I will say that the course material might be too complex for the time allotted. I think the instructors did a good job, but some of the topics were pretty advanced and likely required some knowledge that was beyond the scope of the course. Some of the assignments reflected this. In some of them, I was writing most of the code and could follow what was happening pretty easily. By the last assignment, though, I was pulling code from custom packages that the profs had written and doing regressions using equations that they wrote out for me. I think that was necessary-- going through all of this would have been too time-intensive for this course-- but if I had to write a ML model by myself, I doubt I could do it. 
BUT, I definitely understand the models on a conceptual level. In this sense, the course was very successful. While I likely couldn't reproduce a lot of the code, I understand the computer science behind a lot of it. So overall, I think the course was very strong.",4
10623,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Joanna M,"Jun 21, 2021","Overall a lot of knowledge and an interesting course. I was disappointed that the last part focused more on Machine Learning instead of on databases, data lakes etc. as I feel this would be more relevant to the specialization.
I did not like the assignment as they were not demanding enough. Majority of the code was written for us, it did not require us to analyze the code more to actually understand what we are doing and learn it. ",4
10624,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Dalton E,"Dec 14, 2022","I honestly liked this course. It was a very nice introduction into Spark and wasn't too difficult to grasp. The only minus was the logging-in issues I had with databricks. They deleted my data a few times, so you can see where that would be a bit frustrating. Other than that, awesome course and the end peer-review was actually not difficult unlike the past two courses. Thanks!",4
10625,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Kota M,"Apr 30, 2020","Very great introduction to the Spark SQL and databricks environment worked perfectly as a hands-on.
It would be great if the course covers the Spark ML applications.  We used sklearn in the course and utilized a trained model by using the user-defined function.  I wonder how it compares with the case where we use Sp ark ML for the training as well.",4
10626,"Distributed Computing with Spark SQL by University of California, Davis",Carolyn O,"Feb 8, 2021","The course was a struggle. I didn't take calculus or trigonometry.

10636,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Anand K,"Jun 19, 2020","Too short and fast. For people who are not acquainted with cloud platform and other google tools, it would be difficult to understand. Aslo the tutorial videos are also not descriptive. ",3
10637,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,lee.simon3,"May 27, 2022","This is one of the two worst trainings I have taken in the recent 15 years, courses, subjects, units of universities, Coursera, Udemy, Pluralsight, etc.. all included. 
Why? A student comes to learn about things. They generally hope, by implication, to be taught by qualified staff who know what they are talking about and who know their courses. These people are not here. The people in the videos are not answering questions. Those who answer questions here don't know much about the course. Students have to give them links, after already telling them section titles. Even when they replied, students would have to try hard to bring them to the course material under discussion - otherwise, they wrote about something else. 
Furthermore, they are definitely not subject experts who are qualified answer such highly technical subject matters. They can give students links over the Internet, in most cases. Then, why do students come here? Youtube and Internet would be enough. 
Number 3, the course is terribly created, scripts mostly read to students by machine-generated voices. Materials were mostly quite randomly put together. Later materials cannot find earlier discusions for foundational discussions. There were many concepts not explained, discussions where prior foundations could not be found. 
If this is not enough, after students have tried to finish the course by the due date, there is a lab that has been denying students' access for over three weeks. Three weeks! Not enough to resolve an issue. I have personally contacted the 'staff' here, Qwiklabs support, Coursera support, multiple times, trying to find a way through or around. None of them cares. They asked students to wait. It's been three weeks!!! The course itself is only three weeks. Students come to this lab at about the end of the second week. The only outcome is that students will have to pay more. I told them of this. How did they help? Nothing. No workaround. 
I have gotten so many apologies that I realize they are mostly copied and pasted and sent to me. The small merit this course has is that there are videos and support staff replied, often by scratching the surface.
In short, the course is a perfect representation of the greed, greed, and more greed of the training provider. Productivity, profit and scale of operations are their objectives. Not students' education and welfare. ",1
10638,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Mirko J R,"Apr 3, 2019",Very theoretical.,3
10639,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Dustin W,"Jun 24, 2020",Not just an issue with this course but it happens with many of the Qwiklab labs. Some of these labs demonstrate complex topics but don't go in to the details. You're given a bunch of command line commands to run which are usually about setting up the environment (local & cloud). Then when it comes to the specific sub-topic (why you're setting these variables) it has very little to say. From that point you're left to research the topic yourself and it can take some time to find it in the documentation. It would be far better if there was call out links to the documentation so I don't have to break my flow of learning taking 15-20 mins to find the information I need in the documentation. ,4
10640,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Sinan G,"Oct 27, 2018","A lot of great production examples, labs and reviews but perhaps too many issues for a single course - however I understand that it was perhaps to provide an overview of the possibilities, a kind of ""toolbox"" for production ML.",5

10648,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Thiru K,"Oct 28, 2019","The first module was really good, but the others just seemed like an ad for GCS. Also, the 3rd and 4th module the labs / lab video was hard to follow and felt like I was just reading random code.",3
10649,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Xin P,"Feb 21, 2020","Overall this is a very good course. 
+ Working as a less experienced data scientist, I gained a lot of hands-on knowledge when putting a machine learning model into production. Especially the dos and don'ts as well as what to pay attention to. 
- It would be better to provide more architectural overviews, or further readings, regarding ML on Google Cloud, just for people with less GCP knowledge to catch up easily. Also 2 hour for an exercise is a bit short as I need to hurry up when there is a lot to do in that exercise. Even though I can also start the same exercise 2nd time, it is a lot of hassle to repeat the previous steps. I would suggest that depending on the % of people which can finish the lab, extend the hours for some of the users. After all you have this data and can do some analysis, isn't it? ;)",5

I wrote lots of notes and found myself asking 'how' a lot with no answer. It also felt like I was constantly being pitched to buy and use GCP services. And finally, to actually build a product off these tools that could be considered 'production', I don't think having a bunch of notebooks and random CLI commands to launch stuff is the most robust and traceable architecture.

10736,Production Machine Learning Systems by Google Cloud,Melissa R,"Dec 12, 2019","I was really hoping I'd gain some real practical skills and knowledge about the different aspects of building and deploying a machine learning model on GCP. Even though a lot of real estate was covered in this course, most of it was theoretical, and I cannot say that I ""really"" learned how to implement them if I were working on a big machine learning project, which was exactly why I took this course. The only labs that had some practical aspects to them were also disappointing; one only looked at a number of Java modules and the other was a demo of Kubeflow that I couldn't follow at all, and was different from the lab itself! First off, the fact that Java was used in the first instance took me by surprise, and I wonder why the same thing couldn't be accomplished with Python. I have zero knowledge of Java and that was uncalled for, but tried very hard to make sense of the code. But I won't definitely be able to write it myself. And in the case of the last demo, I simply couldn't understand what the instructor was doing and where! 
I expected a much much much higher standard from this course, but overall it was quite disappointing and I cannot say I took anything away from this course other than some theoretical concepts about various subtleties when it comes to ML on GCP! It would've really really helped if there were more actual lab work included in this course, just like the previous one and each concept was accompanied by one such hands-on lab, and concepts were explained step by step.
The other thing that was very odd to me (and is the same for every other course in this specialization) is that a ton of material is squeezed in Two Weeks. It would've helped if they were separated over multiple weeks. This change in the organization of material would really help learners to visualize the flow of topics.

The lectures were engaging and the material was presented in a way that was easy to understand.
One of the things I appreciated most about the course was the focus on hands-on learning. We had the opportunity to work on real-world datasets and practice applying the techniques we learned. This was extremely helpful for reinforcing the concepts and gave me the confidence to tackle more complex data analysis tasks.
The course also did an excellent job of preparing me for professional certifications. I feel much more confident in my ability to pass exams like the Certified Data Professional (CDP) thanks to the thorough coverage of the material.

Test 18 provided a dead link for how we were supposed to solve the problem and there was no instruction on how to complete otherwise. I reached out to Coursera on multiple occasions asking for support and was basically ignored not counting a couple of useless responses. I will never take a Coursera course again after the embarrassing level of customer service and given the fact the course clearly had not been updated in so long that the content was so far out of date that we are receiving dead links to content. I was supposed to complete this course months ago and am just finishing now because the only way to finish this test was to blindly guess at numbers and loosely make some of those guesses based off of the feedback from other students who were struggling with this on the discussion board as well. It's a shame I leave with this impression because the course has potential and I did learn a fair amount from it, but I will not get past how poorly I was treated by Coursera's customer service and how little they cared that the course was setting students up for failure. I took this course because I do not have a strong analytics skill set and it was described as being for beginners.

The first week a brief introduction to Numpy is provided with emphasis on what is important from Python programming to remember. It is not an introductory course neither in Python nor in mathematics.
The course gives a first idea on how the differential and integral calculus can be applied in business economics and in the training on numerical computations either by hand or by algorithm writing. Further, it gives a good understanding in numbers rounding that is important in computations. After each video lecture before the quizzes there is review theory and several short examples on programming for personal improvement. Thanks John-Hopkins University for this interesting skillset.

The quiz questions are badly-worded, with at least one answer in every quiz completely wrong. The assignments refer to concepts that aren't covered until later weeks. The final assignment doesn't even have a working link to the data! And the choice of Plotly/Python for the final assignment is ridiculous, ensuring that students (even those familiar with Python) spend more time struggling with syntax than applying any of the principles the course teaches. It would be better to have a 'tech-agnostic' assignment so students can use what they're comfortable with.
The lectures themselves and course materials are good signposts to other resources, but that's about it. The lectures themselves are - I'm sorry to say but I have to be honest - difficult to follow without the use of subtitles.
