5,Data for Machine Learning by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute,Emil K,"Mar 22, 2020","The instructor is great, but please fix the programming assignment! There are so many typos it's embarassing. Also, the autograder EXPECTS typos in some variable names, so you can't even pass it if your answers are correct.",5
6,Data for Machine Learning by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute,L S m,"Jun 26, 2020","The experience with the programming assignment was very bad.

7,Data for Machine Learning by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute,Kirke B L,"May 27, 2021","It was a great course except for the 3-hour data cleaning assignment using Jupyter Notebook.  Other Jupyter assignments worked fine, but this was was so extensive that it completely bogged down my (high end) laptop.  After an hour or so every keystroke was slow.  I rebooted and restarted multiple times and I was unable to finish (solely due to the technical challenges).  It took me literally 2 hours to manage to raise by score from 19 to 20 to pass the darn class, struggling to get one more scored point to process and get graded.
Having said that, the instructor is terrific and I found it very informative (primarily as a refresher after a long career in data management, but I learned a number of things too).  Well worth the time invested (not counting the very fustrating technical difficulties mentioned above).",5

61,"Data – What It Is, What We Can Do With It by Johns Hopkins University",Emily M,"Aug 31, 2022","Information was well presented and easy to understand. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because many of the quizzes and at least one of the final assessments had glitches in their programming where either none of the selected answers were counting as correct for certain questions. The final assessment includes a question where the correct answer choice is ""the first two answer choices"" but because the answer choice order randomized, the statement ""the first two"" was not always correct.

Topics on time series forecasting is a bit of a challenge but follow the videos and exercises, you will be fine:)",5
116,Introduction to Predictive Modeling by University of Minnesota,Nikos B,"Jan 30, 2023","It is one of the best compact course in Excel spreadsheet in coursera. It covers several advanced topics in Statistics and Data Analysis by using a lot of advanced techniques in Excel combining with the corresponding literacy. 
The main syllabus prepares someone to follow other methods in Machine Learning and Time-series Statistics (like, ARIMA) or Classification Methods, even though to learn these important methods. It was a happy moment to learn about data cleaning and several concepts like Pivot Tables, Interaction Statistics, Seasonal Analysis,... etc. 
After this successful attendance, I am very confident to work on Prediction Analysis by using a spreadsheet and being able to explain what happens in different numerical results and graphs. This course applies as a complement unit to a solid background in statistics and mathematics (i.e., series expansion, F-test, etc) for a better understanding of the common stochastic models in Time-series module. It is not a mathematically  oriented unit but the mathematics is the basic thinking.

i) Course only implements K-Means which is a very simple algorithm, instead of this or in addition to this implementation of few advanced algorithms like DBSCAN or CHAMELEON should be added.
ii) A no. of times prof only seems to be reading the slides which make things a little bit unclear i.e, the sentences used should be more common or explanatory rather than just reading the slides which the student itself can.

I found the lecture material unclear or vague at times, so that for certain topics understanding heavily depends on one diving through the provided reading material (which I found very helpful). However, the topic of evaluation is very dense in the lectures and the provided book chapters do not provide relevant insights as well, making the programming assignment for this part quite challenging (at least if not already deeply familiar already with the concepts involved).

232,Cluster Analysis in Data Mining by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,geoffrey a,"Sep 2, 2017","Good, thorough coverage -- for a 4-week course -- of how to cluster.  I liked the evaluation of clustering topic especially.  Very few other instructors seem to discuss the vitally important evaluation of clustering results in any depth when they teach clustering.  Dr. Han explained a comprehensive framework for understanding the effectiveness of any clustering system.  I had never seen some of this material before, even though clustering was a topic appearing in a couple of other data science or machine learning courses that I have taken in the past.  Ideally I would even wish to see this course extended to 6 or 8 weeks, so that case studies on difficult real datasets can be clustered.  For example I had a terribly difficult ordeal last year before I took this course, trying to cluster the Kaggle.com dataset of the BOSCH competition.  It has about 90% missing data in every row, and there are 2 million rows in total, and about 4500 columns!  Kaggle's BOSCH is a SUPER tough dataset to work with!  I hope to come back to try the BOSCH dataset again using my new knowledge of clustering some time soon.  The reason I chose to run unsupervised clustering on this BOSCH dataset, which is ostensibly intended for supervised learning, is to eliminate significant amounts of the missing data from being exposed to multiple individual supervised learning models by prior clever grouping of examples.  I am still postulating to the current day that clustering and creating another unique supervised learning model for each cluster is the most important step to eliminating missing data in this particular problem.",4

302,Predictive Modeling with Logistic Regression using SAS by SAS,K,"Oct 27, 2022","This course was far more confusing than the other courses in this specialization. Part of the confusion, for me, stems from the fact that there was rarely any generic syntax provided. The other SAS courses I've taken provided generic syntax and explained various statements and options so that when I take notes and apply these procedures to other problems and other data sets it is relatively easy to make the connections. In this course the only syntax was in the demos and was already applied to the problem used throughout the course, leaving me to have to figure out why certain (macro)variables or data sets or values were being used in a procedure. I will have to go through all of the content of this course a second time to retain a lot of the information. ",2

I came into this course after taking an introductory SAS programming course, and, at times, I felt underprepared on that front. I wish I had more experience with SAS coding and the SAS software before I began this course. However, my knowledge of statistics and ability to pick up statistical concepts got me through the tougher parts of this course. Looking back, I wish I had waited to take this course until I had more experience with SAS. That being said, it is a well-made course. It is just not for beginner/intermediate SAS users.",4
329,Statistics with SAS by SAS,Ken L,"Sep 7, 2023","Absolutely top notch course for introductory as well as some more advanced statistics. It will be easier if you have had courses in statistics previously. That notwithstanding, the instruction is very thorough and can be managed by those with limited statistical experience if you go slowly, take copious notes and repeat some of the more technical lessons.
These SAS courses are an incredible value given the lesson quality, the SAS software access, and the library of data sets to practice on. There is very little wasted effort and the course builds on itself in a very logical way. If I had any minor quibble it would be the trade-off between instruction in statistics vs. SAS statistical programming sometimes results in the actual programming code being a bit rushed through. This would be fine if the programming documentation was more helpful. Nothing would benefit more from AI than SAS's documentation/help/assist features since they aren't more user friendly than they were 25 years ago. 
I highly recommend this course if you need a comprehensive review of hypothesis testing, ANOVA, linear and logistic regression. Terrific course.",5
330,Statistics with SAS by SAS,Andres F,"Apr 13, 2020","Thank you for an excellent course.
The statistics concepts are revised in a conceptual and meaningful

statistics that provide further understanding.
The technical topics are complemented with recommendations
on how to build models, analyze outcomes and apply the results.

examples that were thoroughly analyzed during the practices and can be used in the
future.",5

 It's not easy to digest some of the concepts without some self-study

taught. An improvement could be to cover less topics and use the time 
gained to give some more examples and clarify some of the math.",3

There is no person in charge to provide any response and not enough knowledgeable learners around. So basically other than posting the final report, it has no use. One recommendation for improving the courses quality for better is to add to the JMP tool sections more and also the quiz and exams be more comprehensive and through to cover more.",4

401,Analyze Stock Data using R and Quantmod Package by Coursera Project Network,Cristina S H R,"Jun 14, 2020","These guided projects only work if you are allowed more time until you finish the project completely.
I don´t care if most people would do it in 2 hours. But I only got 2/3 of the course. I didn´t get to the part of Sharpe´s ratio.
The time given for the course does not allow you to take notes. Moreover doing it virtually means that you don´t get to practice it in your own computer with your own R package. So you end up with an empty certificate, not having anything to be able to replicate what you learnt.
Moreover it is for beginners in R, but not for beginners in Finance. So the course leaves you with an emptiness in your learning.
If I had paid for learning in this project I would be furious!",1

I am not sure when did we talk about 'outliers' and 'singletons' in Task 5. In the answers, Task #6 was referred. Was there a Task 6 dealt with, in the video? I couldn't find it in this project.
3. Did you miss ""Does not"" in Question #4 statement: ""Which of these snippets express a ReLU function""?
All in all, it was a nice course. I do have an understanding of auto-encoders, compared with PCA now. I look forward to more such courses....",3

All the code is written and provided for you, so you don't have to do any higher-level critical thinking or problem-solving. The quiz questions at the end simply check if you can copy and paste correctly. If you are looking for a project that presents you with a problem,  gives helpful hints and resources for finding an answer on your own, and then provides an answer with an explanation - this project isn't what you are looking for.

This course is too basic - but gives you a good idea of what to do. Seaborn and 3D plot is just brushed at the surface  - so if you are here for these - better read the contents section.
I wanted to understand how to make surface maps and contour maps - but these were hardly touched.

The instructor seems to just copy the spec_augment library from some GitHub repository without showing which package to install. Overall I would say this was very poorly executed.
Very little discussion was spent into why spec-augment was used at all? Even a signle statement saying that the masking improves the Robustness of the Acoustic model (without the LM) on datasets such as Librispeech without any noise aware training shows good results would have sufficed. ",2

Anywhay then the corrected code  wouldnt run because it seemed to still be running the wrong code, and I ran out of time and patience - it isnt a two hour course - at leadt not for me.
I think the format needs seriulsy rethinking - the explanations and instructions are confusing, and delivered too quickly - it became an exercise in 'monkey see - monket do"" with no real understanding of images, servers, ports, forwards, and a host of chained other stuff - it really needed a slide, or a picture to explain the complex chain of 'somethings' we were suppose to set up.

The implemenation was way too basic; it did not provide particular insights that weren't readily available on the Internet. The idea of paying to watch somebody coding is to grasp their expertise when they solve a problem. Here, the approach was very naive and simplistic. By instance, one important question that one should address is: how Prophet compares against ARIMA or exponential smoothing. I know, there is a paper explaining that, but just as we do when creating a ML model, one creates several approaches and benchmarks each of them in order to select the best.",1

A lot of videos come directly from the company. I don't have anything against that company, but business and learning are 2 very different things. The link with Microstrategy seems to have led to lazyness : so many low-effort contents (assignments directly taken out of the Microstrategy website, poor structure of shared documents, etc.), endless auto-promotion of the book of the teacher. I really felt like the CEO of Microstrategy was kind enough to share with me his views on BI (which might be the goal of Microstrategy with their partnership with the university). I am not happy having paid for this. The other courses of the specialization are great though. Please remove and rework this particular Course 4 from the specialization.",1

First of all, the teacher has a very difficult accent to follow, which wouldn't be so bad if at least the closed captions were accurate themselves. Second, the material taught feels very generic and theoretical, without a single good example to give them some context. The addtitional material and lecture notes feel very dated too, which is evident as the field of Business Intelligence has rapidly evolved over the decade. Finally, learning MicroStrategy is probably the only good outcome of taking this course, but even so there are quite detailed free tutorials in the web that could do that. All in all, this course is in big contrast with the previous courses of the specialization as a learning experience, and I would advise Coursera and the University to make an effort and update it.",2

Overall, it provided a good introduction to BI. The content is covered on a high level but has the essentials to get you started. Unfortuntately, the lecturer was a bit hard to understand at times. The supplementary notes were very helpful.
Parts of this course were contrasting with other popular BI books. But that's what happens with blurry concepts such as BI. I liked the assignments although sometimes the instructions were a little unclear and you have to wait quite some time for your reviews and you have to wait for assignments that you can review. Overall, I recommend this course for getting started with BI.",4
716,"Business Intelligence Concepts, Tools, and Applications by University of Colorado System",Oluwatoyosi O,"Mar 31, 2021","I have only given this course 3 stars because the course content is very good, and it has helped me improve my business intelligence skills. However, it saddens my heart to see that appropriate measures have not been put in place to address students who have been flagged for plagiarized work. Yes, I notice the recent development of appending our e-signature before submitting an assignment. I really hope this would be effective in reducing plagiarism.
I have flagged several students in this course who submitted my assignments from week 2 to week 5 word for word. In fact, one of them forgot to remove my name.
To learners who work hard to do their assignments, don't be discouraged when you see your work plagiarized by another learner. Always remember that your goal is to improve your skills because this is what kept me going in completing this course.

Additionally, the quizzes don't seem to test for real-world BI knowledge, rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some BI topics.  Furthermore, the additional readings need to be culled significantly, it looks like someone just googled BI topics and then copy and pasted the links they found.  Please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the 4 to 7 reading that rank the highest.  A pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this.",2

Anyone with basic IT background would be comfortable with the course. Learned various concepts of Business Intelligence; and microstrategy as a BI tool is good for analyzing. After I am done, I am going to spend more time looking at other tools of Microstrategy and apply those in the capstone course if required. I came across some students facing issues with microstrategy in the Discussion forum but I think improper installation or hardware and software support could be the cause.

First of all, two garbage software needs to be installed for this course - and Oracle VM and Microstrategy Workstation. 
The Oracle VM is not used at all through the whole course and is required for the next Course in the program.
For the Business Intelligence and data visualisation, we are required to use Microstrategy, which is a pain to install. You need a corporate or student email to register in order to download the program. And any technical support for the software is behind this corporate account login you need. If you don't have a corp/school email you can use another version shared by the staff but good luck getting technical support and there are no external forums or support platforms at all. Why not use a more-widely used BI software, like Microsoft Power BI where we can go online if we have any technical issues or to find documentation?
The lectures also do not go into enough detail on BI usage and skills. The videos are really superficial; not enough time is spend on the whole data gathering - cleaning - report building processes, or what type of visuals to use for each kind of data, or any type of general knowledge every BI professional should know. Sure, there are loads (seriously, loads) of external links shared after each lecture, but why am I taking this course if I can just go and read some external material?

846,Advanced Business Analytics Capstone by University of Colorado Boulder,Alexandros N,"Nov 26, 2020","I took the Advanced Business Analytics Specialization as a full time student. I finished the first four courses in more or less 3 weeks. In the last course needed to take the Specialization Certificate, the Advanced Business Analytics Capstone, the assignments of the course during the 2nd-3rd-4rth week were locked until 20 December - 5 January. That means that I had to wait more than one month, and pay 2 more subscriptions to Coursera!!! In the forum of the class there are more than 20 moderators, none of them has even one reply in anything. I made a thread, nonone replied to me. I contacted the customer service, they told me that they are sorry and they cannot change it.
This is not a policy of an educational institute, this is an attitude that wants to take only your money. If you want your certificate, come back after two months AND KEEP PAYING!! I canceled my subscription, I do not want the certificate, I want to cooperate with organization that respect my effort, my time, my money, to respect me.",1
847,Advanced Business Analytics Capstone by University of Colorado Boulder,Sally M,"Jul 10, 2017","This is a very poorly structured course. Assignments are not clear. The grading rubrics have multiple errors. 
For example, week 1 Assignment: ""Data visualization - part A. Create a plot to illustrate the distribution of interest rate (int_rate). Make sure to use a plot appropriate for illustrating distribution.""
Distribution plots are histograms, density plots and dot plots. The rubric first asks if one of those plots was used. Then the next question grades THIS SAME PLOT based on relationship between two variables (scatterplot), NOT distribution. I correctly plotted a histogram, but lost a point because it was not a scatterplot?! It's not supposed to be!
Another example from  the same assignment: ""Are there columns that have rows with missing values or outliers? The missing values are tagged as NA in the dataset. Suggest strategies to handle them.""
4 points
8 correct columns identified as having outliers (installment, annual_inc, revol_bal,revol_util, total_acc, acc_open_past_24mths, and total_pymnt) and strategies to handle them suggested
3 points
At least 6 correct columns identified
etc.
There are only 7 columns with outliers!!! You list them and only them in the first answer choice. Yet I lost a point because it's not 8 columns!!!
The ASP is a joke. It is SLOOOOW. Like, the assignment that should have taken me an hour to do turned into 6 because the platform would crash every 30 seconds. I can't believe anyone actually pays to use it. We'd be much better off using a programming language like R or Python to do these assignments.
Also, the assignments that depend on running a model in ASP should specify what random seed to use in partitioning the data, what exact classification tree type to use, so that we would all get same answers, and it would be easier to grade other people's work.

I recommend using tools other than the Analytical Solver Platform if you know how, e.g. Jupyter. The data set will absolutely not work on the cloud version of the solver (the VM/server hangs and crashes with every operation). The Mac version of the solver is useless for the second week, but does the third week of the assignment just fine (simulation & optimization). The Windows version of solver works flawlessly on Excel - I wasted so much time getting it to run on the Mac, don't even bother.

872,Fundamental Tools of Data Wrangling by University of Colorado Boulder,ΜΙΧΑΛΗΣ Τ,"Apr 30, 2024","*Recommended*
As a novice I finished the ""Expressway"" specialization from the same Uni/ instructor and then enrolled to ""Data Wrangling with Python"" specialization. This one has a higher tempo, but still, I was able to complete it without delays or confusion. Totally worth the time/ effort, as:
- Instructor Di Wu's lectures offer examples and explanations
- All courses are structured efficiently
- Notes and exercises are very helpful
- Assessment is not stressful (it mostly requires some self-discipline)
If I had to pinpoint something that needs attention, that would be python syntax: However 'easy' and 'instinctive', here we have a new argument, there a new syntax shortcut, not to mention the libraries' specifics. This is not a ""bad"" per se, it is more of a realization of my own (non-programming) background.
All in all, a great set of courses.
Gonna enroll to ""Data Analysis with Python"" next. ",5

876,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Frank A N,"Nov 17, 2018",I have taken several courses on Coursera and this was by far the worst. First the course contained no lectures. The authors had basically copied segments of their textbooks along with code samples as teaching material. I could have done better by simply reading the textbook myself without paying for the course. Finally the way the final assignment is graded is terrible. It is as if the course organizers have completely washed their hands of any responsibility. You have to grade three peers so that your assignment will get in line to be graded. But there is no time line and the process is completely arbitrary. Students have to actively seek others on the class forum to grade their assignment (they will return the favor ). I really expected more from a course offered by JHU.,1
877,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Francesca O,"Mar 7, 2018","I was really disappointed in this course. Most (if not all) of the materials are copy / pasted from a book that is free online. While I can get past that, my biggest concern is the actual content and assessments. 
The content covers really basic examples and explains the concepts superficially, then the assessments expect students to be able to apply those concepts to a higher-level problem. As a university professor (and a cognitive psychologist), I completely understand the purpose of having students apply the information they've learned in a novel situation or environment. BUT that is only useful if the student has foundational knowledge on which to build. This course is akin to reading a dictionary definition, then being expected to apply it to an intermediate-level problem that resembles nothing you've ever seen. In the case of this course, the majority of my (and others', based on the forum discussions) learning was outside of the course. I have a hard time believing that any of which I ""learned"" searching for answers is going to stick with me long term. 
The final assessment does not lay out the requirements (on which you are later graded). There are multiple things you get points for having in the code--even though a handful of them are not required for fully capable code--that are not specified as requirements in the final assignment. This isn't so much about the course per se, but something I find irritating and an impediment to learning in general.
That being said, I found the swirl assignments useful and engaging, and the course content was fairly easy to get through. 
Overall I think more relevant examples would be useful, as would a more-detailed explanation of some of the concepts. If you take this course, I'd prepare to spend at LEAST a few days at the end of the course scouring the web for more relevant and detailed answers to your questions that were brushed over, if even addressed at all, in the course materials. It'd be better to go look for examples while you're learning instead of waiting until the assessment, though (if you're interested in decreasing the tax of the final assignment and increasing the potential for long-term learning).",1
878,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Trenton H,"May 1, 2017","Lacking in content.  The OOP portion of the final project was poorly constructed.  The instructions were unclear and the exercise seemed futile.  We took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object classes.  I think a better example could be used.  Since there are already plenty of ways to do the things our objects were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise.  I think a different type of real world object should be used, perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame.",2
879,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Damian S,"Jun 1, 2018","Coverage of R Classes is good and helpful, but on the whole this class is a huge disappointment.
The ENTIRE course is text, apparently adapted from the creators' book.  They also have the audacity to suggest you buy the book as well!  Save yourself the trouble and just buy the book, or don't bother with either.  
They also very much push the ""tidyverse"" school of R programming... it's useful to know and have in your toolkit, but there are many other approaches to R programming.
Also, support was very bad... Left a question on the forum about their code which didn't execute as expected.  It  has been two weeks since I left the question, and have since completed the course, but still no response.
Finally, there is no mention at all of vectorizing code, which is what R is optimized for.  As one of the most basic tenets of R, it is surprising that an ""advanced"" course makes no mention of it at all.",2
880,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Hayden M,"Oct 4, 2018","Much of this course is well-constructed, well-communicated and clear. Sections from weeks 1-3 were attuned to my programming skill level and the material was communicated generally so that those with experience in other languages could also follow along easily. I had no technical problems with submitting assignments or quizzes and I found the assignments with swirl to be effective in reinforcing the material from the readings. My biggest criticism of this course is about Week 4's content and its respective part in the final assignment. The content in Week 4 concerns Object-Oriented programming and  this material was really hard to absorb. It seemed to come out of left field and the readings did not feel as clear as they were in other sections. The readings essentially say ""Here is what object-oriented programming allows you to do [create/manipulate classes and objects]"" but then goes back on itself by recommending that you do not use object-oriented programming to create custom classes or data structures because the R community already knows what data structures they like. Personally, I had a lot of trouble understanding this content because it was so briefly explained. This did not help me by the time I had to complete the object-oriented programming portion of the final assignment. It is very clear from the class forums that other students have found that section of the assignment particularly difficult for years. Overall, this course was excellent in teaching functional programming principles and application, but the object-oriented section slightly spoiled my experience of the course.",4
881,Advanced R Programming by Johns Hopkins University,Adam M,"Mar 7, 2017","The first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.
The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP. That meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.

This is not necessairly built to be self paced.  First the way deadlines work and are graded is frustrating.  WHile some people reviewing my work commented that my work was impressive, it can take a lot of time to get your work being graded.  When you are stuck somewhere, this is not a classroom setting where you can deepen a subject and get to understand.  It is especially true when the explanations are relatively shallow.  I had to go back to a datacamp class to fully understand object language programming.

1060,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Олександр В,"Jan 1, 2018","In my opinion the course is designed very poorly. Firstly, I was expecting the Capstone to cover different aspects of the rest Scala courses more or less equally. But in fact this course is 80% about math and java performance tuning and only 20% about very basic Scala. Secondly, due to the poorly designed given skeleton methods it is very difficult and cumbersome to write a performance effective solution. In order to generate real images I had to write two implementations - one for the grader give me 10/10 and another one that really works and is capable to generate images effectively. Of course I had to get rid of all the given method signatures and reassemble the pieces in different way. E.g. performing more computation in Spark, combining several steps of computation in one, preferring stream style  processing with less memory allocation etc. Actually I have found myself spending more time fighting with the given skeleton and the grader, rather than writing a workable solution.
Also, if I were designing this course I would rather go from the top to bottom when slicing the implementation into layers, steps and weeks. So the first step would be to implement a UI using mocks, then replace some mocks with the real code and so on down to the Spark level, reading the CSVs and proving the real data for the solution. This way the student would clearly understand how the methods being implemented are used, giving him much more input for creating a good design, rather than just blindly implementing some methods that _somehow_ will be used in the next week etc.",1
1061,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Marcio G,"May 10, 2017","The course's introductory description, ""In the final capstone project you will apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data."" is quite misleading. The fact that this course is cataloged under ""Data Science > Data Analysis"" also suggests that the course's project is data-centric, but that's not the case at all. This course requires very little data manipulation (basically only the first milestone) and no data analysis at all. The project is for the most part a ""Slippy Map"" implementation in Scala. Suggesting that this application has anything to do with data science to appeal to customers is down dishonest.
But even if you're forgiving about the absence of data science and you're satisfied with Scala only and think that you can use the final product of your labor to showcase your skills to employers, I'm afraid that it wouldn't be very helpful.
The ""fill-in the missing code"" grading model (all methods signatures are pre-defined and you have to complete them) robs the student from the opportunity to practice or showcase any object-oriented / functional-programming design skills. In my experience, that's what employers want to see. Can the candidate design code that is easy to change? Does the candidate's code follow S.O.L.I.D. principles?
For the employers that are more algorithm-centric in the interviews, I think that is  unlikely that they will ask you to implement algorithms taken from Wikipedia. They will usually give you a problem and ask you to either design an algorithm or find the proper algorithm to solve a problem on your own.
The instructor also suggests that Spark could be used, but that's untrue. Even though the library dependency is in the SBT file, you can't actually use it given that the template code wasn't designed for this purpose (large collections are unnecessarily kept in memory and you can't change the design without making it incompatible with the grader) and, again, you would only use Spark on the first milestone.
Unless you're interested in web maps, I don't think that this project will be very useful for you. 
Regarding grading, I managed to make every single milestone pass the grader's tests, but that's not an easy task given that the grader messages are quite cryptic and don't follow TDD best practices (tests should be ""executable specification"", they should document the requirements and should be readable).
Many times a submission wouldn't pass the grader because of small differences in the parameters you have chosen in your implementation. The grader messages aren't very useful and given that you don't have access to the grader's source code, you have to resort to trial-and-error, which can be very frustrating. 
They even hide crash and timeout messages, so your submission might fail and you don't even know which one is to blame. All you get is a ""0/10"" score and no clues on why it happened.
I truly recommend anyone who wants to showcase Scala work, to create an application from scratch. Even if you're not bothered by the cons that I mentioned, I'm pretty sure that soon enough (I took the first iteration) you will find people sharing their solutions on GitHub, which makes the certificate pretty much meaningless.",1
1062,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Benjamin S,"Sep 12, 2017","In this course, you are asked to apply your Scala knowledge to a more practical project.
However, I found the tasks rather confusing and lost track of the actual purpose of the application. In the end I just implemented everything function by function. So it felt more like in exercise in understanding the goals of the course instead of a Scala training.
If the goal is to develop an application that feels a bit more real-world, it would be good to have more vivid explanations of the business logic, for example in videos and not just as text.",1
1063,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Rubén R,"Jan 31, 2018","All the exercise are poor explained and It's need a hard math background. It's not a scala or functional course, It's a math exercise problem with scala.",1
1064,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Артем К,"Nov 6, 2017","Let's start with cons. Not often, but one have confusing exercise explanation(method docs contradict with assigment text), sometimes explanation is unclear in general. Too much geo math and in general course exercises look like ""realize some formulae"" definition. Grading tests output basically useless and it's sad. Tests must be the main point that explains proper way to right implementation and at some point being spec explanation.
But some pros for me exist. Geospatial is not one of my biggest-fav-domain, but it was interesting to dive into the new fields. The next thing is the oportunity to work with some kind of real world data processing scala application, it was quite interesting.
I give it four stars and a half. At the end my feelings tell me that I rather like this course than not. Yes, it has some certain rough edges, but this course help you to level up your scala and spark skills and to fill one's hand.
In the end I want to give some advices. If grader falls with out of memory, try to optimize extraction code. Spark is not always the right tool for all cases. Also, Spark has awesome web ui where you could watch what happens and where is main bottlenecks. Write your own tests... even simple test can help to find out bugs that you could think is not expected. That's all. Thanks for the good course.",5

I was not. Instead of learning functional design or applying big data analysis framework everything just worked with simple "".par"" after large collections. I don't remember myself optimising memory usage or reducing shuffling with spark. What I do remember are hours of fiddling with floating point precision trying to figure out why a test fails with ""30 is not equal to 30.06"". Moreover, tests were just not good enough: even after I've passed week 1, I had to come back to that code when tests in subsequent weeks were failing. Lastly, complexity of the weeks is badly balanced. It took me three weeks to complete Week 3, but I've finished weeks 4-6 in about 2 hours.",1

1067,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Li Z,"Sep 4, 2017","I've read a lot of reviews before me and see that they mentioned several cons: off-topic programming assignment, imbalanced difficulty distribution and instable grader, vague feedback information.
For the few points mentioned above, I'd say I've experienced all of them indeed, it's true.
But for a project that's to be called ""real"", you're gonna have to adapt yourself to production environment and work like a true professional. That means you gotta tolerate faulty situations and ambiguous specifications. (Quite often, you don't know WTF they want, but you'll eventually come around and hand in a piece of code that runs smoothly with the right output.) It's something you deal with every day if you work in a tech firm as an SDE, RSDE, etc..
In terms of this kind of blank-filling programming assignments, it's just fine for me. Some argue that they should allow us to write everything from scratch and judge the grades by the output, allowing more flexibility for the developemt process. I think the skeleton code is simple enough, leaving enough freedom for you to mess around. If you allow me to start from scratch, I'm gonna finish it with C++ or Python.
The one thing I say they should really fix is the instability of the grader. Random failures and insufferable waitings are the two things that take away most of the fun. The programming assignment itself wasn't so hard, but was made unnecessarily much harder by these two factors.
For the sake of the previous four courses, I can spare 4 stars. But I understand those 1 stars.",4
1068,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Tobias G,"May 15, 2017","In my view this course fails on 3 fronts:
1) the construction of the exercises is quite poor: they don't build well on each other and they don't really produce a sensible application, because many optimization opportunities are ignored - for example, to avoid having to calculate the same thing multiple times, to ensure that lists are ordered for quicker searching etc. If the idea is to teach novices good application development this course fails miserably.
2) the fact is you can pass this course without writing a single unit test, and without producing a working application - in fact, you can get 10/10. This seems wrong for a 'capstone' project.
3) Because of the design of the exercises (the function signatures) it is hard to make use of Spark in a sensible way. Spark is surely a major reason many people follow the overall program. Why does this project not build on the Spark course? That would make it really interesting.",1

By the end of the project it would be helpful explaining how the Layer class was actually structured as well.

I used spark in only the first 2 milestones and then after that it was parallel scala collections the rest of the way.
Not much of my knowledge from parallel scala course was used i feel like but i could be wrong.
also my desire to use spark in the beginning messed me up once i got tot he 3rd and 4th milestones which i recognize is my own fault but it would be good if there was a stronger hint that these higher level libraries are no longer appropriate.
what makes this harder is that the grader is very opaque when running into timeout / out of memory exceptions. doesn't tell what test caused that error nor does it give any more details. Trying to replicate the smaller machine environment locally during testing did not really help at all.
Just consider making those errors more explicit. Would make it easier to debug and then easier to proceed with the course.
Anyway, thank you for a great course and specialization overall. I learned so much and am greatly appreciative that I was able to learn Scala.
All the best!

1133,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Michael L,"Jan 12, 2020","I did the original courses back in 2016 and have used Scala consistently in various roles. I've done so many courses, I wanted to just finish this one and complete the specialization. I think I'm familiar with various Typelevel projects, SBT itself (I wrote a cucumber plugin for it) and have used Shapeless and Cats in anger. I'm familiar with ScalaCheck and have done a few O/S projects. This course ... perhaps I'm being unfair, but the project doesn't feel 'idiomatic Scala'. I think the course could use some of the Typelevle libraries as a starting point and lead devs into how to write functional Scala. In my experience - Scala is used a) for a functional programming language b) to drive Spark.  Just as people will use Python for numpy/tensorflow (e.g. you can't compare Spire with numpy).  The ML niche is lost, so I hope the content of these courses will still be useful for another 5 years.",3
1134,Functional Programming in Scala Capstone by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Ryan S,"Jun 12, 2018","I enjoyed this course, but I believe there are some errors in the grading code related to interpolating colors. I raised an issue about it on the week 5 forum but never got a response. The project was interesting, but it would have been nice if there was a way that we could have been a bit more free in how we designed the interfaces. If you were trying to use something like a spark RDD it made it pretty cumbersome, having to always fit everything to an Iterable at the end. ALSO, I tried to add a library when I was doing this to add the shapeless library to this to add some interesting features which would have made the code a lot more general. I spent days getting it to work, only to realize you library dependencies are not actually imported when you submit, it only runs with the base ones that were pre-defined. A warning about that would have been nice.",3

I found myself enthusiastically telling my colleagues about the data files and the spark code to join them. After that it got a bit too simple perhaps. And a little contrived. Some of the curried functions you had to fill in were way different from what I'd have written if I'd been staring at an empty screen and even after the course I've still not learned why I'd want to use this setup. The Signal bit in the last assignment was just plain silly, I think. It remains completely unclear why you'd want to use Signals here, other than that you want to refer to materials from the reactive programming course, and the sample code for the update doesn't actually work because the update method is protected.",3

And the only info grader gives you is the message about timeout. It would be better if requirements for milestones 1-3 were harder to fullfill or milestone 4 would not depend on previous code. But it depends and if your solution is inefficient it's very painful to search the problem all around the code. It's offered to use spark and other tools in this project but using spark is also painful. I get inconsistent result from grader with occasional OutOfMemory exceptions, but this project cries to be implemented with spark.

Also, it appears that correctly completed neural network translators don't appear to produce very good translations, at least in the form we were asked to design, and I think there should be some comment about that from the instructor.  Is it because the embeddings we were given were not that great?  Was it because the network we designed was not deep enough to be effective, or was our custom training loop not well conceived?

The introduction of every lessons lasts only a few minuts. The coding tutorials offered by the GTAs are neither insightful nor explanatory, where the learners are simply required to type along. Theere are also consistency issues the way the code, so that many manners can be confusing for beginners. 
The assignments are not designed with the resources in mind in that, some of them require an increadibly long time to train, unless it's migrated into colab, where other issues like loading pretrained models and datasets need to be taken care of. Also, the instructions are at times vague, and the problems can only be seen once graded. No or not enough efforts were made for step by step checks and guides to help the student.

Structure of course was easy to follow.
The downloads were a nice touch.  
The code and tools were clearly and concisely explained and resources were provided for each new learning in case a student wanted to drill down further.  
The actual dataset and the results of the analysis were not impactful or very interesting, i.e. a better dataset and with better 'ah ha moments' could have better illustrated the power of the tool.  There were many instances where the instructor was explaining the meaning of the findings and basically it was inconclusive.

There is no emotion or natural speech in the videos. From an educational perspective, it is as wrong as it can get. It is really an effort to overcome the monotony of the speech. There are very, but very, few graphical aids to help understand the concepts. Just a person talking (and not in an engaging way at all).

I even think that this kind of  videos drag out the learning process. I can read the transcript faster than the audio, so I often end up putting the video on mute while I read the transcript. Moreover, the transcript contains numerous punctuation mistakes. It would have been better to upload the text that the teacher is surely reading aloud. I am confident that the written text would be clearer. Just let me download the pdf that she is reading and I would go through it withot having to stand the videos. They don´t add any value.

The methodology and the way the material is explained are the worst I’ve ever seen on Coursera. If the intention of the course was to engage people into the subject, I think it has fail tremendously.

I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques.

1450,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Shawn M,"Mar 1, 2019","I have been progressing through all the courses in this specialization and, overall, the courses have been of tremendous value to me. However, it's really not the courses themselves but the book that goes along with the courses that deserves the four and five star ratings I have previously given (these courses are really nothing more than ""read the book"" and ""take the assignments""). Nevertheless, the knowledge gained is not easily available elsewhere. 80% of this visualization course (i.e. the book) was excellent and I give it top marks. The other 20%, starting with the grid system section to the end of the book, was terrible. These sections need a complete rewrite as they are barely comprehensible and certainly not comprehensive. The final assignment does not test you on how much you learned in the course, rather it tests you on how much time you spend on your own finding other relevant sources of information on the internet to figure it out. Also, I don't understand why creating a custom geom would be a more important software development skill than R Shiny for example, given that having the ability to develop interactive apps is critical to visualization.  I will give this course 3 1/2 stars, rounded down to 3 since coursera won't allow a half star. I hope the authors take what I have to say as an opportunity for improvement since I have benefited tremendously from this specialization so far and I would like to see it improved in certain areas.",3

It was bit of a struggle in the course project as the examples in the Mastering Software development e-book were little simplistic in nature. Overall, very satisfied that I can create my own geom. The key learning was on creating visualization using spatial data. ",4
1465,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Daniel F S,"Apr 21, 2020","Like other courses in this mastering, it is a little bit outdated and the practical tests proposed are way harder than examples presented before, but still worth doing because of book, ""getting hands dirty"" and forum.",4

1472,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Sam H,"Aug 28, 2021","I will put it like this, you will learn the ggplot2 package to a decent extent if you go all out reading the materials and learning the in betweens for the inner workings of the package (without cheating). You will learn a thing or two about the ggproto classes used to build all of the little geometries used to make those cool plots you've read about and how to use the stats, geometries, and grid layers to make your own graphics. This part of the R ecosystem (ggplot2 and grid) has a lot of missing parts that should be documented. For example, you'd think you could add ggproto classes together since that's how the ggplot2 syntax works, right? Wrong. Dead wrong. And this is just one of many little edge cases you learn through trial and error. You will lose your head trying to understand how ggplot2::layer and ggplot2::ggproto behave in the edge cases, but you'll learn a lot in the process.
I learned ggplot2 more than I think I ever wanted to. The book does a decent introduction to the graphics ecosystem for ggplot2, but it's not enough. Use browseVignettes(""ggplot2"") to assist you because the book is simply not enough to finish the last assignment. You'll get proficient at this graphics language, but this has less use than the other courses in this specialization. And grading is peer based, just to warn you, post your shareable link in the forums if you want a timely response for your certificate.",3
1473,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Zdenek K,"Jan 9, 2017","So first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structured, with good sources. My concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes + graded assignment in the last week. The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.
Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.g. plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data. I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz (programming assignment for instance).
I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better.",3
1474,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Chao G,"Jul 10, 2019","This course is not as satisfactory as the second one, ""Advanced R Programming"". You spend most of the time reading the book they wrote. There is no video lecture or interactive quiz. The most annoying part is the peer-reviewed assignment part. This is a coding project where you need to create your own geom. I understand that building your own geom is an advanced topic in visualization using R. However, at least for me, I rarely have this need in my work. The example and the dataset they use for the project isn't very interesting neither. Overall, I think this course should not be included in the specialization.",3
1475,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Shengdi W,"Jan 23, 2019","Content on ggplot2 framework is solid. However, no video or explanation to complement the textbook, students are expected to learn by reading solely.
Final assignment requires prior R programming knowledge, which is not taught in this course. This can lead to frustration in the end. Probably those who are enrolled in the entire specialization will find this assignment more manageable. I personally had to spend more than 20 hours on this supposedly 4-hour assignment.",3
1476,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Kevin D,"Jul 17, 2017","You'll learn how to make a custom geom, and apply what you learned to an interesting dataset.
This course has though an insane difficulty level, mostly because you don't have the information you'd need to succeed easily. I'd only recommand this course to people following the entire R specialization: if your goal is to learn how to make a custom ggplot, follow an external tutorial, you'll avoid being frustrated.",3
1477,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Ben S,"May 2, 2020","This course was a massive struggle.  I gave up on it for two months as I just found the package development for the geom to be way over my head.  Definitely learning a lot, but ",3

1484,Building Data Visualization Tools by Johns Hopkins University,Ben S,"Jun 5, 2017","The designers of this course designed a final assignment that is way beyond the curriculum leading up to it, and judging from the discussion forums it gives everyone severe headaches to deal with it. They know of the situation, but rather than alter the assignment they just added new ""lessons"" that boil down to ""Why don't you go read some more material in this other person's book about creating graphical elements? You'll be fine!"" I am paying to take this course so I'm more than a little ticked off about this.

It really is not about the technical steps of getting started with applying machine learning for your business. The practice lab in the course can give you a little bit of insight about machine learning tools provided by Google Cloud, but that's not really helpful to understand how you will then use them for your specific business. One thing that is severely lacking from this course is about how businesses ethically obtain data from the customers or how businesses should appreciate customers' privacy right of their data. At its core, this course is really a good introduction of applying machine learning for businesses from management perspective.

It is a must for anyone trying to understand what Machine Learning is and its application with a holistic view. I’ve been studying ML on other Online courses for over a year now (focusing on the math and programming aspects), so this course turned out to be a great complement to all the other technical courses I’ve been doing. Furthermore, whereas the other courses followed a more traditional school setting (e.g. power point slides, thousands of mathematical formulas) this course was such a nice surprise as it is quite dynamic, light and with a touch of humor.
This course is not meant for learning the math or programming; there are many other courses online with that purpose. (If you want to implement what Eric has shown in this course on your own, you will need to learn: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics and a programming language, such as R or python before trying to implement ML models). This course though, should also be taken by people like me who are trying to learn the technical aspects of ML. The many examples in the course help construct a thorough understanding as well as provide a framework to participate in ML meetings. I do intend to recommend this course to a few managers of my company for them to understand what my team is trying to achieve. Given that there is no math/programming requirements, it is perfect for non-technical business people to realize the potential benefits from ML. ",5

I'm not especially interested in working in a business environment per se, but this course really teaches you how to fluently talk about the non-technical aspects of ML and data science. The unit on ethics I think is particularly important. The software demos are also really helpful whether or not you plan to use SAS. Honestly this course was so well rounded. I really enjoyed Eric Siegel's presentation. He manages to be extremely funny while also really effectively teaching the material. My only criticism is he tried way too hard to sell his book at every opportunity and there were not many readings that weren't written by him.

I was helping other students understand the assignments, and spent extra time grading submissions as no teaching assistants were available to help.
There were a couple of very good teachers in the specialization, however the structure is critically flawed and your time would be better spent studying on your own.

all the stuff you learned in the courses belonging to the Big Data specialization coming together in hands-on exercises, that not only test your knowledge but also are fun to do and give you a real taste of a Data Scientists work.
In the beginning, it´s a bit overwhelming, how many new technologies and programming languages you are introduced to and have to exercise, but it is definitely worth it. And the course material is well designed, that you do not get lost. You get a lot of help in the instructions, that even beginners should be able to succeed.

I will say that I felt there was a huge gap between what was taught in the Neo4j course and the Neo4j assignment in the Capstone. I'd learned a lot from the assignment, but it took me loads of time and their were parts I still don't really understand. There are also a some broken hyperlinks to previous course material. I'd also like to see better support for a paid service. There is no interaction from a Coursera employee or course instructor in the forums at all.

You're also at the mercy of peer reviewers, who may grade unfairly if there are technical difficulties, and who may not grade you in a timely manner. (Or they don't submit their assignments so you can grade them in a timely manner.) The videos have WAY too much B-roll and not enough visual aids. 
I am a beginning Python coder and took this class to expand my Python knowledge, and I have a science background so I understand a lot of the math going on here, but I don't think this course would be a good choice for anyone without familiarity with Python. Perhaps if I'd taken the SAS route with the intention of learning SAS I would've had a different experience.",1

1844,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Nicolas K,"Feb 8, 2016","The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS & Python). At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning.",3

Near zero interaction from staff, short videos leave a lot to be desired, and worst of all, there seems to be a problem getting everyone's assignments peer reviewed (which makes no sense). 
There is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a ""contact us"" link on a page, but get this, the link isn't there.  Students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the non-existant link.  In an online forum it's important to actually address concerns. Replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages.  And that's the feeling I get here. 
This course requires a DIY attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedback. 
If you're looking for a good example of online learning, look elsewhere.",2
1851,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,John F,"Jul 13, 2020","Some of the presented python code has been depreciated; this would be particularly challenging for students new to the code. The use of quantitative variables is not well described at the start of the course which would add challenges for students who choose these variables and are marked by students who have not.  Having beginners marking beginners is not an effective evaluation technique.  I did not receive useful feedback on assignments; typical statements included ""."", ""good work"", and, ""needs improvement"".  ",2
1852,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Pradeep,"Dec 8, 2016","A very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with Data. Emphasis was on teaching Data Management with area of our interest. In Order to support this, assignments didnt had clear objective. I would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignments.
Not a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews. However, this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset.",2

1855,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Josh K,"Dec 15, 2020","I felt like I was missing reading material throughout the entire course and had to search on the internet to figure out the answers to my questions. I discovered at the end of the final week assignment there was additional reading material that I should have seen at the beginning. 
Throughout the course, no explanation was given for the code we were using and I do not feel I was taught to use Python or SAS in a way I could repeat outside of this course. 
I chose to use the Gapminder dataset, which turned out to be a big mistake since it has no categorical variables. I could not complete assignments without learning Python from other sources, such as stackoverflow, since so little direction or explanation was given in the lesson.
At the end of each video a question is asked, but they often use terms that were never mentioned in the lesson. Again, it is as if there was a textbook I was supposed to read but I was not told about.
I am going to continue with the specialization, but I suspect online learning is not for me, since there is nobody to ask for help and the discussion forums are empty except for posts from several years ago.",1
1856,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Adrian L T,"Jun 20, 2022","I was very enthusiastic at the beginning, althoug the lessons and how they were taught I did not like, I intended to complete the whole specialization courses. But soon I noticed this course is not attended by instructors or barely participants for many years -or so it seems-. The blog system was not very good, specially if the whole thing is not properly conducted and organized. Some informations are outdated and not corrected. The peer reviewing was bad, too. I was getting assignments to review, that are 2 to 7 years old and nobody cares if it blocks the whole reviewing process. Very annoying. I could not help peers and I could not get reviewed either, as one that I got to contact was also getting old assignments to grade until we graded each other. I wrote in Forums but no answer came. The participants, if any, did not appear to greet either. I am sad about this because I was eager to do the whole specialization but no way. I quit.",1
1857,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Ivan K,"Jan 25, 2016","The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far.  Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review).  Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.",1
1858,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Claudio P,"Apr 14, 2017","I am disappointed because the course doesn't provide profound material on data analysis with python. The videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos aren't thoroughly explained. For instance, the speaker often only says what she is doing but not WHY she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is. I felt left alone and forced to google. In my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the course.
Considering that this is labelled as a beginner course I was expecting much more theoretical input. Other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up.",1
1859,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Eelco H,"Feb 5, 2016","Very disappointed about this course. The topic is very interesting, for me at least, but the course organization is horrible. Lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. Zero interaction from course staff. Issues with getting assignments graded. In previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk, but you cannot easily contact coursera directly. 
Main focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating. Be warned and don't pay for this course!
I really don't get why this course has so many good reviews.",1
1860,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Wanfeng P,"Oct 18, 2016","The professor and instructors don't understand how to properly write SAS programs and ignored constructive feedback.  It's very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes, ignoring programming conventions.  
As an analytic leader in healthcare industry (I am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training), I want to say something to the students graduated from this course: if you program the same way as being taught, you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview.",1
1861,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Emily,"Dec 26, 2017","Basically: The course is geared more towards those with quantitative research questions. While it's a good introduction to the theory of research data management, and they encourage you to choose your own research question/data set, it's quickly obvious that the lessons mostly apply to those with categorical data. As my research and work deals with qualitative data, there wasn't much for me until Week 4.",1
1862,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Subrat S,"Nov 9, 2015","The support from the faculty and the website is beyond explainable bad.

1868,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Glenn B,"Jan 30, 2017","This is a good course. I have done stats in the past so i was using this as a refresher but also to advance my python skills a bit more. I think you should take an introduction course to python first. you will get more out of the coding examples. I suggest the Intro to Python by the University of Toronto at Coursera. I found that to be an excellent course.
I find that in these lectures they do a great job in explaining the stats theory. They do not dwell to much into the science behind it but more the applicability. This is all good. You can simply do a little additional research and get the pure science behind of it all",5
1869,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Anupama R,"Sep 19, 2015","Great course, teaching end-to-end on how to select data, ""prep"" it up, analyse data using SAS/Python and create custom visualizations. The project based course makes it more enjoyable as students can quickly apply the principles presented in each week's videos. The resources to learn Python and SAS may not be make you a ""star"" programmer (since this is not a programming course), but are more than adequate to get a newbie learn enough to process data and work effectively. Definitely recommend to anyone to get an excellent head-start on data analysis from a business and academic research perspective.",5
1870,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Rusmat A,"Jun 23, 2018","This is not a course for learning Python, and the coding is straightforward as you are given examples for everything. What this course does do is to give really well-presented, high quality lecture materials and (possibly uniquely) allow you to choose a research topic and matching data of your choice to use throughout the specialisation. For me, this is much more motivating than doing analysis on data you really don't care about, just for the sake of it.It's fun to read your fellow student's research blogs, also. Really looks like students on this course are from all over the world.",5
1871,Data Management and Visualization by Wesleyan University,Γεώργιος Κ,"Jun 4, 2018",in fact this is a 4.5 star rating. The level was introductory. The peer assignments are not the best tactic. They can be an adding  to other examinations to see how others treat the same problem.  But in fact what you learn in that course are a must. If you are new to data science with little or not any knowledge of  Python or SAS then this course is ideal for you. If you have already gotten acquainted with data analysis then this course is to support your skills and maybe you can find one or two new things. ,5

Lecture quality is varied--some quite good (such as the lectures in Boot Camp I) and others seem like he hadn't looked at his notes for a long time.  It's great to hear a stats professor talk about the strengths and weaknesses of many approaches.  It complements a mathematical statistics book quite well.  It would have been nice to have had some problems that were more challenging.

1993,Recommender Systems: Evaluation and Metrics by University of Minnesota,Andrew W,"Feb 4, 2018","This course was very helpful for giving me a breadth of exposure to various ways to look at evaluating recommender systems.  Having faced a very similar problem evaluating a recommender system for a legal document search/suggestion engine (like Google News for lawyers), this gave me a proper ""birds eye"" perspective on that problem that I wish I had before. We faced exactly the same problem you describe of finding the proper tradeoff between precision and recall, or search vs. discovery.
BUT what is lacking here is teaching us how to go implement these different evaluation metrics in practice.  Sadly I don't feel any more equipped to go back to that legal search engine client and guide them toward a very concrete decision about the right metrics to use.  I would just come with a mix of new opinions of metrics they should consider -- but how should they choose?  what offline evaluation should we do? what online experiment could we run to decide?  etc.  If you had run us through problem set/assignments involving real-world situations like this, where we had to calculate these different metrics (given sample data) and come up with compelling cases for different metrics to use for evaluation, I would feel otherwise.
That said thank you for your hard work putting the course/specialization together. I hope my feedback helps constructively, but don't see it as criticism.  It's because I am very enthusiastic about what you've been teaching me -- and I plan to go implement it for new clients of mine in my Data Science consulting practice (www.waterwaydata.com) -- that I only want the course to be the best it can be for others too.

theory, methods, and tools (the ones used or similar tools) are new to you, you
will most likely love the specialization and the capstone. If you are familiar
with parts of the theory or some of the methods and tools the specialization
still offers a broad overview of the field and some interesting insights.
 For the
latter group (those who have some experience in the field of computational social
science) the capstone might feel a bit redundant. You can do the 4 assignments
in 10 to 20 minutes (because they are basically replicas of the peer-review
assignments of the previous 4 courses of the specialization and very simple).
You will then wait for days or weeks for peer reviews. That was a rather frustrating
experience of an otherwise good specialization. ",3

2120,"Computational Social Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Andrew O,"Aug 8, 2020","Well done to Prof. Hilbert for putting together a wonderful course. One thing I found is how hard it is to counter fake news from the artificial simulations. Shows how true the old saying is, when a lie (or advertisement) is repeated enough times, people start to believe it. That is the power of the media.
I am keen to explore the potential of these tools further.
One potential drawback is the stereo typing of individuals based on big data personality assessment. People can change overtime and not only that, the use of language can alter too. So the assumptions underlying the construction of natural language assessment may need to be reviewed to stay relevant.

2125,"Computational Social Science Capstone Project by University of California, Davis",Venetia K,"Jan 18, 2022","The most challenging part was not the software related to learning the skills of computational social sience (NetLogo, Gephi), but the requirement and reliance on other software such as Excel, desktop screen recording and computer cameras to capture our work and narration, having to find a way to upload big video files - which for me meant starting a YouTube channel. All of that made the Capstone and earning the certificate in general super stressful. Waiting for peers to grade and counting on peers to grade carefully and well was also another disappointment and stressor. 
What was taught and what I learned was amazing. Sometimes it was difficult to not have a solid source other than peers to ask questions.

2130,Relational database systems by Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Derick L,"Dec 9, 2019","I have given up on this course, as the content is too academic and mechanical in nature. Definition after definition, with little practical guidance on how to *design* good databases for real-world use.
The quizzes and assignments are terrible - sorry, just telling it as I see it. The sequence of topics and assignments doesn't flow. For example, why are we shown a Sybase modelling tool, that doesn't use Chen notation, but the preceding video and subsequent assignment use Chen's?
Only academics use Chen's original notation - anything real world has far too many entities/attributes for this notation to be usable. Also, none of the tools that I've seen out there use this notation for that reason. Crow's foot or IDEF1X, or even UML; never Chen's.
On the other hand, the style of presentation in the videos is engaging, rather than the usual voice over powerpoint with varied settings, and a lot of well thought out animated examples. A shame that it just doesn't fit together well and focuses too much on academic concepts and not real-world practice.",1

You can find most of the content with a quick Google and I don't see why anyone should pay for this. The exercise in week 2 was just a copy-pasting exercise. The exercise in week 3 and 4 are not doable since the data is not given. The exercise for week 5 was great and I enjoyed it. I feel that the exercises for the other weeks should follow the one in week 5. Week 6 just had two super short quizzes. I did not learn much from this course. ,1

2244,Designing data-intensive applications by Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Gunnar W,"Oct 30, 2020","I understand this is an integrative course for the previous three courses, but it adds very little - The videos and excercises basically rehash what was learned in the other three courses.",2
2245,Designing data-intensive applications by Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Aidan M,"Sep 6, 2021","This course, along with the previous three in the specialisation, are by far the worst offerings I've seen from Coursera. Real minimal-effort syllabus design, the videos involved just reading bullet points with zero in-depth information, general advice or tips. For all I could tell, the instructor could have been someone that was pulled in from the street that day and asked to read some course notes to a camera. The most horrifyingly half-arsed, broken part of the course, however, had to be the assignments. Usually I really like the idea of peer-graded assignments, but the idea was so woefully implemented here that it made the assignments essentially useless. First of all, putting the SQL scripts to populate a database in order to do the assignment in the CORRECTION RUBRIC for marking OTHER people's assignments once you've finished your own, making it necessary to open the marking scheme pdf and copy & paste the commands in order to start your own assignment? The marking scheme, which in a proper peer-grading system shouldn't be available until after you have submitted an assignment! That is so obviously broken I shouldn't need to say any more, but on top of that, some of these SQL scripts didn't even run as they were given in the marking scheme; there were mistakes, inconsistencies, incomplete translations from Spanish, etc. The quizzes too followed the general theme of absolute minimal design effort to the point of leaving open the possibility that this course was put together by people who genuinely have no knowledge of the subject at all. It was painfully obvious that the questions were made by scrambling a question-answer style list of definitions, and in one quiz the exact same question was repeated, showing a lack of even the most basic proof-reading or checking of the course design. There are many more aspects of this course I could include here, but suffice it to say that absolutely nothing about it was anywhere near what I would consider an acceptable standard for an org like Coursera, and my experience in this course was enough to ensure it'll be the last one I do here.",1

From a learner's perspective, I found that there are a lot of small errors in the course quizzes and materials. For instance, there are several questions (in different quizzes) where none of the multiple choice options is correct to answer the question. 
As well, I feel there there are at times huge leaps in materials and lack of organization in material. There are also a few very short videos for each topic that flies through the materials, but a lot of readings (marked as 10 minutes) to external sources/ Python documentation. I fully expect to do readings but I do feel I benefited more from Googling YouTube videos from the same subject matter for a more in-depth walkthrough and explaination. 
Lastly, there was very little support provided by the instructor team. There are discussion forums where students were supposed to post their questions. However, the forums are unmonitored and questions are not answered (there were student questions from 2 months ago that did not have any response).  ",2

Some of the instructors are really boring, but others like the HDI instructor, Jaya's  lectures were very good in quality. The questions within lectures are not properly organised, they ask you questions about topics you're yet to learn. The concept and structure of the MOOC is excellent but delivery and instructors are not that good.

I believe a great follow up for this course would be the design of a specialization program with multiple courses that could go deeper into the technical aspects of the construction of composite indices (aggregation, elasticity, weights, and robustness tests) through a hands-on approach and a Capstone project in which students could apply all their knowledge for the proper construction of a composite index.

Personally, I'd put this module right after the theory modules of week 2.
I found the theory modules of week 2 to be the weakest part of the course. The OECD-JRC handbook does a better job of explaining the steps for constructing CIs - be it at an introductory or a more advanced level.

Video: Benefits for Gen AI for Code Generation - Should be a slide just showing which section you are on. The videos just continue from the previous. There is no introduction to the current section. Sometimes videos just stop and have to be manually started again.

Many grammar errors especially in the in-video questions:
ChatGPT trained on 
- Large Corpus of Text Data
- Small Data

""Open the Google"" -> Open Google (Video: Introduction to CHatGPT)

Video: Log-in Process --> Too many instances of the phrase/filler word ""like"".

Video: Code Generation with ChatGPT --> do not refer to ""The ChatGPT"", instead just ChatGPT. This is the widely-accepted terminology.

Video: Visualization with Gen AI --> Pronounciation of typical words might turn off a broarder audience, e.g. pivotal is pronounced as ""pie""-votal, instead of ""puh""-votal. The visualizations are excellent examples. Perfectly suitable for machine learning and Explorarory Data Analysis. +1.

The readings are very well curated. +1

The course would benefit from interactive practical exercises for those who are not very familiar with the content (besides quizzes).

It requires some relevant mathematical thinking and of course the previous 3 courses of this specialization. 
This course of Simulation Models is built on the main concepts of applied Probability Theory: Simulation, Permutation and Combinatorics using Excel or Google Sheet. The main topics cover distributions and cumulative probability, probability distribution, chi-squared test and advanced modeling of random generating numbers. 
The case studies is about sensitivity analysis in decision making science such as: Monte-Carlo simulation using a simple risk modeling example, discrete-event simulation and counterfactual analysis. All examples are implemented in Excel and some general information about advanced programming if needed. The general approach of this course and whole specialization is about information management and business modeling skills. I am very satisfied of the final gain by learning these 4 courses.

For example, there was no explanation as to why the ""stratify"" option was used when splitting the training and test data with the train_test_split() function.

I have a question, since this formula can be used for practically any cryptocurrency, I tried to use it in ETHEREUM, I downloaded the data from Google Finance, I converted the commas to points, however, in the formula within Google Colab, to perform the forecasting, I tried to display the data for a month, February, introducing data from previous months, and here the error, when entering the number of periods, I did the same thing that appeared in the video, placing ""30"" as a relation to a period of 30 days, however, the result released incomplete months and dates to 202, any solution?

2942,Bitcoin Price Prediction using Facebook Prophet by Coursera Project Network,Aaqil A,"Jan 16, 2021","The project and instructor are good! Enjoyed this quick project and unexpectedly learnt about google finance in google sheets.
Lack of a full screen option for the video was really unfortunate especially since it is a basic feature that you see almost everywhere.
The instructor's video window kept going back to its smaller size every time I pressed the expand button.
Also, the virtual environment is not necessary for this type of project since you can just sign into colab in another browser window. Bad practice to sign into anyone else's environment with your personal details. The virtual environment can be disabled though, so not a huge deal, though the video progress and playback speed resets after disabling the virtual desktop.

2994,Simple Recurrent Neural Network with Keras by Coursera Project Network,Sidney V,"Mar 24, 2024","Positive point:
1) The application example, despite being simple, is interesting from a didactic perspective.

Negative points:
1) The processing logic of the RNN was explained vaguely. For example, it was not well explained why the model used must be formed by a combination of ""encoder"" & ""decoder"". It was also not clearly explained how we can check the number of inputs and outputs of each layer of the sequential model, to facilitate understanding of the model.
2) No figure was shown to illustrate the neural network. This is a serious deficiency in a quick course like this, as the illustration of the neural network would make understanding the model much easier. ""A picture is worth a thousand words"".
3) The cloud platform was very slow, making it almost unfeasible to run the notebook. Because of this, I had to download the notebooks and run them on my own computer, with additional work to install all the necessary Python modules that I wouldn't need to install if I worked directly on the cloud platform.
4) The Python codes in the notebook were created 5 years ago (according to information in the Jupyter ""Files"" tab, which said ""Last Modified: 5 years ago""). Keras has had many updates since then, and the codes used in course are already obsolete. More specifically, the model creation code (Task 3) and the training code (Task 6) did not work with the current version of Keras on my computer. I was able to complete the course and get the certificate just because I did well in the Quiz, but I couldn't implement the model using the outdated codes. I've already spent a lot of time trying to rewrite the obsolete parts of the code. Why the instructor doesn't keep the codes updated? At the very least, there should be a new version of the notebook for download with updated codes.
5) I posted a request for help on the Forum. After 10 days, I have not received any reply. What caught my attention was the fact that the course has 6,085 ""enrolled students"", but the most recent posts on the course forum are from some years ago. How is it possible that a course with so many students supposedly enrolled has an inactive forum?
6) Sorry, but the point that I consider most negative is having to pay for a course with all the negative points mentioned above.

I'm sure that if all the negative points are solved, this course will be a good option to teach RNN.",1

Bad english.
Poorly built tutorial files.
Could have used rmd files with inline codes.
Too much time spent on explaining repetitive steps. Many other important steps were skipped without explanation. When you talk about installing or loading a package, at least say one sentence about its relevance or what it is even. She just reads out the code while writing it. Again, no explanations whatsoever. Mouse pointer covers relevant information or even the code being typed during the explanation. More time spent on explaining the visualization than the code used to create the visualization. This course will be boring for someone with basic knowhow of R language. It will be difficult to follow and useless for absolute beginners as well. Wrong choice of visualization types: For instance, scatter plots being used for discrete data. There are numerous YouTube videos and  free tutorial notebooks in Kaggle that are far better than this. The only useful thing they have done is that they set up the environment and cloud resources. Absolute waste of money. I completed this course only to write this review because it is non-refundable.

Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible.
