0,Introduction to Data Analytics for Accounting Professionals by Association of International Certified Professional Accountants,Adnan A K N,"Nov 12, 2023","""Introduction to Data Analytics for Accounting Professionals"" is a must for accountants aiming to stay ahead in an evolving industry. The course provides a solid foundation in data analytics, demystifies the tools and techniques, and empowers participants to harness the power of data in their accounting roles. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to any accounting professional looking to future-proof their skill set and contribute meaningfully to the data-driven landscape of modern accounting.",5
1,Introduction to Data Analytics for Accounting Professionals by Association of International Certified Professional Accountants,TITUS M M,"Mar 20, 2024","Having recently completed the ""Introduction to Data Analytics for Accounting Professionals"" online certification offered by Coursera, I can attest to its effectiveness in bridging the gap between traditional accounting practices and modern data analytics techniques.

The course is structured in a manner that is accessible to accounting professionals with varying levels of expertise in data analytics. The modules cover fundamental concepts such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, all of which are relevant and applicable to the accounting field.

One of the highlights of this certification is its practical approach to learning. The instructors provide real-world examples and case studies that illustrate how data analytics can be leveraged to drive insights and improve decision-making in accounting processes. Additionally, the hands-on assignments and exercises allow learners to apply the concepts learned and gain valuable experience working with data analysis tools such as Excel and Python.

The course content is well-paced and engaging, with clear explanations and demonstrations provided throughout. However, there were instances where I felt that certain topics could have been explored in greater depth, particularly those related to advanced data analytics techniques and their specific applications in accounting contexts.

The Coursera platform itself is user-friendly, with easy access to course materials and a supportive online community through discussion forums. The option to earn a verified certificate upon completion adds value to the certification and can be a valuable addition to one's resume.

Overall, I would highly recommend the ""Introduction to Data Analytics for Accounting Professionals"" online certification to accounting professionals who are looking to enhance their analytical skills and stay abreast of the latest trends in data-driven decision-making within the accounting industry.",5

Peer graded assignments are FORCED and there are 2 video presentation. Unfortunately people do not want to do video assignments therefore give up half way. Which means there are no peer around to give you grade OR for you to grade. In the 5th course, the situation is reversed. For some reason there are projects that waiting grading for at least 2 YEARS.

I am providing 1 star because the lack of ability to receive credit for valid work seems to be ""table stakes"". It is a minimum bar of performance.  Further, this course is a valuable component in the Boulder masters program.  For a ~ $20K it seems that Boulder may be exploiting students. ",1
78,Data Warehousing with Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics by Microsoft,Koen v d P,"Feb 2, 2022","Quality of the course is underwhelming.

80,Data Warehousing with Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics by Microsoft,Isaac S,"Nov 24, 2022","Good info, but it would have been greatly enhanced with labs you could actually do instead of just read.  Early on, the labs were made in such a way that you could follow along with them(mostly), but they increasingly relied on materials that just didn't exist as their example databases were not available to you.  I don't know why they don't just set up a Git Repo and let the user download the repo into their Azure workspace to get the synapse studio set up and then pull data from wherever they keep it.",2

99,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Mark G,"Apr 20, 2020","If you are following Dr. Severance's Python course series, expecting a similar experience, be ready for disappointment.  Where Dr. Chuck's series is well-taught in-depth information with great examples and explanations, this course series is basically a summary and the instruction to go out and learn everything yourself from the web.  That's an abysmal way to teach, because for beginners to data science programming, there is no basis to determine which is bad or good information you pick up from a blog or Youtube.  
This class is a perfect example of just that, but worse, because there's an implicit trust in a professor from a university the caliber of Michigan.
The lessons are old, and they won't update them.  The forums are full of bug reports and information about code that works when tested outside the class environment, because the class is taught on networkx version 1.11, which was released in 2016.  I'm writing this in April of 2020, and networkx 2 was released almost 4 years ago, and this class is teaching techniques that no longer work because the code is deprecated.  
In every course in this series, I wasted long hours trying to debug what I was doing wrong in my assignments, only to find out that my code was perfect - today, and the grader was testing my work with functions that are no longer valid.
I know reviews can be biased, especially negative reviews, so please read the forums before enrolling in this course and wasting your money.  The quality of education from this series is very poor, and you are better suited to learning from Youtube (sadly) if you want actual information you can use in your work.
Unless you are looking for an education so that you can go back in time and find a job in 2015, this course is a waste of time and money.",1
100,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Aziz J,"Dec 29, 2017","Going into this course, I was really disappointed that I had to take this course for a Data Science Specialization because at a skin-deep level it seemed very irrelevant, and frankly I was at that state of mind until week 4 of this course. 
There are several reasons why I'm rating this course 2 out of 5 stars: 
1) The content of the first three weeks were just informational and should have been covered in one or two weeks.
2) Homework assignments were not challenging at all. 90% of the questions were one-liners and required simply calling the methods of networkx that was discussed. This course would benefit by homework assignments that had 1-2 problems that required us to solve real-life problems from scratch, rather than ONLY calling networkx methods. 
3) There was no discussion on how to get network data. We were just given all this magical data about how relationship scores between employees and future connections between employees... How am I supposed to get that in real life?? Some problems asking us to make a network would've been valuable.
 4) More time should have been spent on prediction and other advanced topics, at least another week to bring the ""Applied"" into ""Applied Social Network Analysis.""
5) I really enjoyed the professor's teaching style. He explained concepts well and had great examples during lectures. ",2
101,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Oliverio J S J,"Feb 26, 2018","This course is a good introduction to graph theory. Its contents are interesting and the lecturer did a great job explaining them. So, what is the problem? The problem is that the course is not called ""Applied Graph Analysis in Python"" but ""Applied Social Network Analysis in Python"". This incongruity in the title of the course (intentional or not) will generate erroneous expectations in the students, especially if we consider that they have to take the course to finish the specialization. Regarding the assignments, they are divided into two groups: trivial tasks that are solved with a single line of code extracted from the NetworkX manual and more complex tasks related to Machine Learning that do not involve putting into practice the concepts of this course but those of the third course of the specialization. I regret being so tough, but my impression on this course is that it is filler content designed just to have a five course specialization instead of four.",1
102,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Luis d l O,"Mar 2, 2018","The lectures are good. However, the assignments are poor: very simple exercises with toy examples, but far away from real applications.

103,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Ryan D,"Aug 11, 2019","The specialization for Applied Data science started strong, with engaging exercises, good instruction, and good recommendations for additional reading and resources. As the specialization continued, the courses seemed to get ""lazy"", and the course topics became more abstract and less applied.
After going through this specialization, I would not recommend this to someone if I could find a better program through edX or another coursera offering. ",2
104,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Kevin c,"Aug 15, 2019","For a coding heavy course, why doesn't the instructor just upload the code used in slides as a Jupyter Notebook? This would save A LOT OF TIME and frustration. Right now, I have to pause the video to copy the code AND write my own notes and it wastes so much time. Not to mention, you can easily be prone to writing wrong syntax when you're trying to keep up so fast, and then you run the code chunk and it doesn't work and you have to go back to that point in the video. It's a simple staple that I would have expected in a UMich course. Also, they don't show how to create networks from pre-existing data, which is how you will usually work in the real-world",2
105,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,David M,"Nov 16, 2018","This is hands down the best taught course in the speciality.

Do note that the assignment in week 4 does pull together the whole specialisation in a real world problem, so if you aren't taking the whole speciality you will need a knowledge of Pandas and SKLearn. Personally I thought it was pitched at just the right level because the ML work is just enough to have to go through the process, without any complicated feature optimisation.
Only wish the other courses worked as well as this one.",5

Its a good general introduction to the theory, with some good exercises which combine network analysis and machine learning.
Like all of these classes, it is getting a little long in the tooth (2016, so a good four years old now, in a very fastmoving field), and it would be nice if it was updated a little, but given that its basic stuff, it is still very relevant.
It would also have been nice to have had a challenging, bring it all together, project at the end of this, but I guess its my job to find one now!",4

It seems that course material has been done 3 years ago, and has not been touched since. The age is showing bit. For example autograder has small issues which could be fixed to remove lot of frustration and extra work from the studet
For example sometimes when returning pandas Series, the autograder requires that it doesn't have a name, but the autograders feedback doesn't give any indication about this. Minus one star because of these. All the courses in Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michican has this same issue.",4

Many mistakes in the slides and codes, and you needed to find the solutions in the discussions. The Autograder was a bit annoying because sometimes you'd spend 20% of the time getting the right solution to the questions and 80% fitting it so the Autograder would understand it. I had to look for Youtube explanations to do the assignments and quizzes because based on what was explained I either didn't understand it or simply couldn't find it in the source material.

127,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Jun-Hoe L,"Oct 9, 2020","Well, the actual score is more like 4.5 stars since I still rate the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng as the best course I've taken on Coursera. Anyway, this course in my opinion is the best course in the specialisation and I'm glad I stuck around for it.  
Pros: the instructor has a very good delivery, and explains concepts in sufficient depth gradually, I really like the way he explained how some measures are calculate using step-by-step examples showing which nodes/edges are being used. Compared to Professor Brooks who either gives very superficial lectures on what matplotlib can do (line graphs) to suddenly going into the technical details of the different matplotlib layers
The assignments are the most reasonable I've seen in this specialisation, tying relatively well with the course lectures (though Week 3 assignment's might be tad too simplistic).  
Con: Outdated autograder as usual, however this was probably the mildest case compared to Course 1 (Intro to Data Science) where so many things were different between the old and new pandas version.
Here's my personal overall ranking of each course in this specialisation from best to worse:
1. Social Network Analysis
2. Applied Machine Learning
3. Applied Text Mining
4. Intro to Data Science
5. Plotting ",5
128,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Emil K,"Mar 1, 2018","So, I passed all modules in the whole specialization and received the certificate. This is by far the best course, and the reason for this is the instructor. Daniel Romero is great at explaining the concepts, expresses himself clearly and uses lots of examples which help immensely. The programming assignments are actually fun to solve - the instructions are clear and well-formulated.  I know what is expected and can focus on doing data science.  For the first time I didn't have to spend hours reading the Discussion Group posts in despair, in order to figure out how to pass the assignments (tricks, hacks, etc). This can't be said about assignments in other modules. I think the assignments were not too easy - to me the difficulty was just right. It's an introductory course to this matter and the worst you can do is daunt learners with unrealistic assignments (as in Week 4 of Text Mining). I think my appreciation for this course is intensified by the irritation with other courses. But at any rate, great job Daniel.",5
129,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Tamas B,"Mar 11, 2020","Daniel Romero is easily the best instructor in this specialization, beating all his more senior colleagues in communicating knowledge to learners. I especially liked his methodical approach to telling the whole story: big picture intuition, formal definitions, Python examples and practical applications.
The course sets you up with a solid enough baseline in networks to be able to continue learning on your own. It is a big plus that the final assignment is really pulling together your knowledge from most courses in this specialization (there is no visualization required in the final assignment).
My only complaint is that the course seems like somewhat of an afterthought to bring the course count to 5 in the specialization. The content in week 4 is particularly short. I would rate this course 4 stars on its own, but given how it lines up in the specialization it is an easy 5-star.",5
130,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Sudheer a,"Sep 28, 2020","nice course with good content in quizzes and assignments. The last assignment was great and very practical (well framed question, which uses ML algorithms to predict node attributes and linkage using various network measures as features). Overall a pretty much useful course using graph theory and a practical course. Most of the assignments are concentrated on how real world problems could be?
The centrality measures are explained beautifully. The module four is pretty much the heart of this course.",5
131,Applied Social Network Analysis in Python by University of Michigan,Dishi T,"Aug 9, 2020",I have really enjoyed learning this course. All the concepts are explained with proper examples. This course not only provides theoretical knowledge about network analysis but also explains the use of each topic in real networks. The assignments were really helpful to get hands on experience of all the topics covered. The most interesting part of this course was the last assignment It was fun experimenting with different models and analyzing the performance.  ,5

224,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",Rohit D,"Jun 20, 2020","Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models (BS3 for short)
 In June 2020, BS3 is a new class. It appears that this class came to Coursera circa April 2020. 
 The class creators (Prof. Abel Rodriguez and others) have done an excellent job of pulling-together the requisite theory (video lectures) and practice (assignments in R).
 For most people, including those with a modest amount of training in statistics or computer science, this class will feel like an advanced class. To reasonably comprehend the material, one needs to be familiar with Monte Carlo simulations (specifically Gibbs Sampling) and a broad spectrum of probability distributions (Poisson, Beta, Gamma, Inverse-Gamma, Log-Normal, Dirichlet) used in Bayesian statistics. The first two Bayesian Statistics classes cover most of these pre-requisites well.
 BS3 delves into two ways of estimating mixtures, namely Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Gibbs sampling, and comparing results from the alternate approaches. BS3 does not stop at a ""Gaussian Mixture of two Univariate distributions."" Through its assignments, this class motivates the need for other mixture models such as zero-inflated Poisson distribution, a mixture of exponential and Log-Normal distribution, and a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions.
 Some assignments require manipulation of hierarchical probability distributions using multiple techniques - Maximum Likelihood Estimation, detecting Conjugate Priors, Simulations - simultaneously. Since the manipulations are coded in R and need to achieve a numerical result, typos and algebraic manipulation errors are unforgiving.
 The class organizers chose to have graded assignments (six in all) peer-reviewed. The peer review requirement can feel like a constraint for a class that is relatively new and advanced, and thus has low attendance.
 It took me ~60 hours to complete this class over approximately two weeks. Ideally, I would have preferred to spread the course out over the recommended five-weeks. Life constraints dictated otherwise. Even so, the effort is well worth it. I am walking away with a much better appreciation of Bayesian Statistics in general and Mixture Models in particular.",5
225,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",zj s,"Aug 31, 2020","This course seems to be a new course only opened in recent months. Compared with other courses on coursera, its attention is not very high. The course mainly introduces the (Bayesian) generative mixture models and the method of parameter inference (EM/MCMC, not involving variational inference). Strictly speaking, it is a small branch of machine learning.
This is a course that combines principles and practice. It mainly uses Gaussian mixture/zero inflated mixture models as examples to explain its principles and derivations, and is supplemented by demonstration codes to help readers understand. At the same time, there are corresponding homework to help readers better understand related concepts. If the homework is done carefully, most of the knowledge points involved in this course should be mastered.
The difficulty of the course is moderate for  me. According to coursera, it is advanced level, and the official estimate is about 21 hours. Of course some pre-knowledge is required.",5
226,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",Murray S,"May 31, 2022","While I liked the instructor and the presentation of the topics, I did find it somewhat tedious to sit through the instructor writing out the various derivations on the board.  I  think the topic would be better served by providing the key results on summary slides and perhaps providing the derivations in an appendix that the student could download.   The instructor provided notes for the course, which are excellent (in general, I find the lack of notes or references to useful books to be a gap in many Coursera courses). ",3
227,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",Tomas F,"Dec 21, 2021","good course, but there are few students taking it, so when you need to advance and make student-based reviews it gets difficult to have your work qualified or reviewing others.",3
228,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",piaoyang,"Dec 11, 2021","This course focuses on the estimation and application of Mixture Model. Estimation includes EM and MCMC, and applications include density estimation, clustering, and classification. And how to compare different Mixture Models during application, and what to pay attention to when using.

Generally speaking, the first two courses are the foundation of this course, and after finishing this course, you can truly understand the application of Bayesian statistics.

For me, after studying this course, I really understand how the LDA topic model is built and solved.

Although this course only talks about two parameter estimation methods, there are many variations in reality, but they are all based on them.

At the beginning, I felt that this course was a bit difficult, but the text materials provided in the course were supplemented in some places that I didn't understand, so I learned everything in the end.

The code assignments of the course also let me understand how these algorithms are implemented, and also let me see its specific practical applications.

A really great course. Although it is difficult, you can understand it through the course videos and materials, plus a period of thinking. 
The only downside is that the waiting time for peer review is too long. I have completed all the assignments and submitted them nearly a month ago, but I have not completed the peer review until now. ",5

232,"Bayesian Statistics: Mixture Models by University of California, Santa Cruz",Pavel K,"Oct 24, 2023","The course focuses more on practical aspects, giving a general view of the topic. The course covers EM/MCMC algorithms for learning mixture of distributions models and discusses some of their pitfalls. Examples of using these models (density estimation, (semi-) supervised classification and clustering) are also given, as well as an introductory understanding of the procedure for selecting the number of components. Unfortunately, there are certain disadvantages in the course. In particular, peer-review submission tasks, where the grade depends heavily on fellow students, their competences and their presence at the course. Even they are optional (honor), these assignments could have been designed as automatically graded programming ones, and then the resulting grades would have been more honest and without the long wait for at least some reviewers.",5

Skip Week 4 Exercise 6.

There are serious bugs in some of the modules.  In Week 3 Exercise 7, the code contains invalid nonprinting character, 0xa0. You'll spend a while trying to figure out how to get rid of them.  And.... even then... the code doesn't work.  You'll see ""Input Data Error. Input data are inconsistent with schema.""  Just don't bother with it.

In Week 3 Exercise 6, you get the same error as in W3E7: ""Input Data Error. Input data are inconsistent with schema.""  Just skip it.

I complained about this in the feedback and opened support cases.  And guess what the tech said?  ""It's not my job to assure that the exercises work.  Please contact the instructor.  What?  Now they want me to do *their* job?  Coursera support is a joke.

Also, some of the modules *incorrectly* reference data sets, REST endpoints, etc.  Sloppy writing.

With the constantly changing variables and information in various fields of study, it is essential for course materials to be updated and reviewed regularly. However, some course materials may contain outdated information or incorrect details, which can lead to confusion and hinder the learning process.
One of the common issues that arise from incorrect course materials is the changing of variables' names. When variable names are changed, it can be confusing for students to understand and apply the correct concepts. This issue can lead to mistakes in assignments and exams, which can ultimately impact students' grades and overall academic performance.
It is essential for educators to ensure that their course materials are updated and accurate, especially when it comes to variables' names. Inaccurate information can create confusion and cause students to waste time trying to understand the material, resulting in a negative impact on their overall learning experience.

597,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Dmitry B,"May 6, 2019",The quality of the lesson material is great but the quantity is nowhere sufficient to get the hands-on experience,2
598,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Luciano M,"Jan 14, 2019",Labs were had less quality than in previous weeks.,4
599,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Cooper C,"Jan 22, 2020","   My feeling is that this entire specialization is a glorified demonstration of what GCP can do with ML. The labs are not interactive and in some cases did not work. I don't feel that I have learned anything new. If I were to use GCP for ML purposes, I would need additional training to do it. I don't recommend this specialization    ",3
600,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,John D,"Jul 18, 2018",Labs vms are to slow.  Speaker is difficult to understand.  Mic varies and speech pattern is not clear.  The presentations need some graphics rather than a guy talking.  Sketch out the ideas on a white board rather than  talking 5 minutes to a single slide.,1
601,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Soham M,"Oct 12, 2018","The best course ever to give you the glimpse of the whole ML land - what is ML? Why ML? and most importantly How to do ML for real life business problems - from developing models to model evaluation, serving in production with all scaling tips and techniques with essence of Cloud. The best course for ML practitioners out there. Learnt a lot and what other place to learn from apart from the people who are actually doing it for the most popular products used across the web and mobile world.",5
602,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Jun W,"May 30, 2018","This final course is also very good. Embedding is my favorite part and Lak is my favorite instructor.

603,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Laimonas S,"Dec 3, 2018",Too shallow to truly be useful. I think if anything it gives you an idea of what's possible and roughly the areas you should explore and learn about but you won't learn too much following this through.,3
604,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Dimitry I,"Nov 15, 2019","Good course, but I couldn't get over the Estimator API. IMHO it's too complicated compared to Keras and I just could not force myself to care about it.",3

Thanks, Google Cloud team form this awesome course. Actually there are many Machine Learning courses or articles out there. But nobody tells me what is the best way to do one thing, why I will use this step for certain things. If anyone tells but he could not show the proper visualization, it is the correct way to do so. Now I will be participating in real-life projects to apply what I learn. If I get stuck then I will use this course as my reference guide.  ",5
607,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Patrick M A,"Sep 2, 2018","This course goes deeper into how to improve your Tensorflow ML models' performance without going deep into the models themselves. A good intro to learn how to systematically tune hyperparameters like the learning rate or batch size, and also how to start using regularization techniques and embeddings. Finally the course also opens the door to custom estimators, keeping you interested for the next courses.",5
608,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,James E W,"Sep 27, 2019","Good class with a lot of information and new terminology thrown at you. Especially if you don't have a machine learning background. The labs are done in a way where you can get familiar with TensorFlow and Python programming, without having to know Python programming. Good intro if you want to be familiar with GCP ML. If you're looking to write a bunch of code this will probably not be enough for you. ",5
609,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Harold M,"Sep 28, 2018","This is one of the best courses in this specilization, as it goes deeper in the internals of ML and Neural Networks. Also, it presents two important features such as Embedding (creating sparse tensors from features) and Custom Estimators, which is the first step to get into advanced topics such as implementing new estimators from Research Papers.
I've really leveraged from this course a lot. 
Thank you!",5
610,Machine Learning in the Enterprise by Google Cloud,Ertu S,"Sep 5, 2018",The only concern is that There are lots mention  of Batch Normalization however nor instructor neither lab exercises point out how to do proper Batch Normalization using Tensorflow. It seem like they suggest manual scaling. Also best to include a section  how to use TensorBoard to fine tune training properly. Not clear how to monitor and correct training parameters thru TensorBoard.,5

A good video is 15 to 20 minutes long. 2. In some of the videos, esp at the beginning, the instructor explains WHAT he is doing but not WHY. I would follow but not understand why I was doing what I was doing. 3. they are COMPLETE, i.e. if you listen, download and re-listen, you will get all you need. I highly recommend you download them and put your notes along side.  ",4

But the course is delivered with such neglect and laziness that I have no choice.
I can't belive that in a signal processing course the lecturers didn't even bother to normalize the sound, it was terrible to
listen to the lecture and every time they played a guitar signal the volume just blown up and caused me momentarily deafness.
The whole course is passed via the command prompt with no command history view on, 
so if you want to see what were the commands just a few steps before thats too bad for you, you have to rewind it.
They didn't even bother to remove the typo mistakes they did, and no solutions to the exercises.

Half way into the specialization the creators sold Turi, GrapLab's parent company, making it non available to the general public (not even by paying) and then all the knowledge devalued. I wish I had known this and I would have enrolled on a different specialization. The creators still give you the possibility of using numpy, scikit learn and pandas but I had already done a lot with GraphLab create. The time I invested on my nights after work became a waste. I was trying to convince the company I worked for to buy licenses for GraphLab create. 
Coursera should not allow folks to create courses that promote a private license course because it would make people waste their time and money if they decide to privatize the software.  
Don't take this course, and if you take it then only use GraphLab create when the authors give you no other option.

1256,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,Tsz W K,"May 15, 2017","The materials presented are excellent with well prepared skeleton codes for all ML models. Comparing this course to its three preceding ones, this course is more challenging both conceptually and computationally. The slight drawback is that, because of the highly technical nature of the last three weeks' materials, there isn't enough guidance about how one may construct the ML algorithms from scratch, that is, learners with less experience in computing will, more or less, have to accept the sample codes with little confidence about how to (re)write such codes in the first place.
As a result, I believe that learners with more experience in algorithms and data structure (or learners who proceed to learn more about this area) are likely to gain more from this course for at least two reasons: i) they are more comfortable with the complicated ML algorithms; ii) they can improve the algorithms to speed up the estimation time (some advanced techniques are quite computationally expensive, say over 20 minutes).

It's a shame that the specialization stops here, as a capstone project with the same quality of these 4 courses would really provide the students with something they can show off to potential employers.

To sum up, great content, great materials (Excellement videos, excellent slides, great assignemtns and quizzes - not a single bug!!!) in a very pleasant and engaging presentation. One work... THANK YOU",5
1263,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,vacous,"Apr 19, 2018","Very good content, and great practices. Coding a algorithm from the scratch definitely helped my understanding. The more challenging knowledge like LDA and HMM in the last two weeks are not covered well in great details, but I can understand the course design since that the foundation knowledge required to understand of those algorithms are much more advanced than the previous ones. 
Overall, I enjoy this course and the specilization overall, except the Graphlab part which is very confusing and rarely used in the industry. ",5
1264,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,Kim K L,"Oct 4, 2016","Another super course. Though admittedly (for me at least) very difficult to make within the allotted time given for one period of the Course.  Lots of advanced stuff that require substantial studies to really comprehend, i.e., it should never be enough just to hack & run the code (that's the easier challenge). Still have a long washing list of topics coming out of this Course that I need (want) to understand better. But at least the background to do so is neatly provided here. So without further ado ... Applause!",5
1265,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,Uday A,"Aug 13, 2017","Thank you so much, Emily and Carlos! Really liked all the courses, and I daresay these are the best ML courses available online. Very insightful, and also cover the mathematical part of the algorithms. Since there are now just 4 courses in this ML Specialization, I would mostly jump to Andrew Ng's new Deep Learning Specialization for further studies. But will look out for your remaining courses to be available once more. If and when they come out, it would be great to send out a notification. Thanks!",5
1266,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,Diogo A,"Jul 18, 2020","Pretty good course. Week 4 is somewhat rough going, but well worth going through. I would like to suggest that the instructors spend some time also discussing essential ML tasks such as web scraping, data cleaning, and format conversion (e.g from Wikipedia text to an Sframe format) as from my own experience these tasks consume around 80% of the work of a Data Scientist. Great job, and you get to keep very useful and well commented code with which to implement your own projects!",5
1267,Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval by University of Washington,Ridhwanul H,"Oct 17, 2017","Like all the other ones, this as well was an amazing course. The topics covered in were the most interesting ones till now for me, as earlier days when I started programming I used often think about problems like these and used to wonder how it was done. Now I feel like I might be able to do them. 
Its a shame that you no longer provide the Recommender System course, since that was something I was even more interested in, and its kinda sad that I am not gonna have access to it.",5

Each lab starts the same way - connect to the google cloud, allocate a vm, check out a git repository - exact same repository for all labs. It takes 10 minutes. Not 10 minutes where you can go away and have a cup of coffee - 10 minutes where you have to be there and accept terms, answer 'Y' etc. If the labs are done outside the Coursera context you would be able to pick up where you left off in the previous lab - zero setup time.

On the downside, some functions used were deprecated, there was sometimes inconsistency between versions in labs (for example automatic upgrading to Tensorflow 2.0, which was incompatible with other libraries used in the lab and things like that).
Also, in my opinion an insight into the models' results is lacking. There was a nice explanation of the performance in content-based part, but later during hybrid and context-aware systems there was no comment on models' accuracy in comparison to the original basic solution.",4

The problem is, there wasn't much groundwork in the course to build a good foundation for the students; they just did a brief introduction to the concepts, then rushed through the code implementation. Slowing down the videos did not help at all; it actually made it worse. The labs are another story, but then everyone else seems to be complaining about that, as well.

One example is the final lab of week 2, where you should be building an end to end solution, but instead you get a lab that only focusses on a topic from week 1.

This is far more efficient compared to reading a book filled with mathematical expressions, especially if you are new to this area like me
However, I found the ppt could surely need some polishing. During the course 1/2/3, a lot of times you will find that prof Koller speaks about many details and crucial facts that are not even shown in the ppt!  Although she wrote down notes sometimes but the notes were hard to recognize (might need a OCR lol), so this is not good if you take screenshot and want to review later.
The 24h cooldown for the final course exam should be reduced at least, if not removed. 4 to 6h is sufficient for a good student to review problem and make correction. And also keep in mind that for the final exams, you don't get to see your answer or any hint about your error once you submit, thus quite challenging and sometimes frustrating, but could be rewarding once you pass.
Among other things, some lectures have bad audio quality, CC are incomplete, and the discussion forums are not very active.

It intrigued my interest more in this field.,4
1540,Probabilistic Graphical Models 3: Learning by Stanford University,Marcelo B,"Mar 6, 2021","Although the contents and the way Daphne explains the subject are of top quality, the rest of the specialization leaves a deep frustrating feeling. There is no TA present at all during the courses. Since the quizzes and final exams are dubious, sometimes pedants, and written in an extremely confusing fashion, you end up guessing instead of applying what you have learned. The book is essential, not a recommendation, and needs to be carefully read. Moreover, PAs are not clear, sometimes as a chunk of some other larger PA, the code is full of bugs so that sometimes only Matlab (nop, no Python, sorry) works, and sometimes you have to look into the net to see how to correct bugs to be able to submit the code. Again, no TAs, so all fall into the blogs, and forums. This is very, very frustrating. The final exam can be re-taken in intervals of 24 Hs. So if you happen to start three days before the end of the course you may find yourself paying again to just take the final exam. An interval of 4-8 Hs may be sufficient since the lectures are not so long. Since the confusion in the questions of the final exam is huge, almost sure you will have to re-try the exams at least twice. I think the intention was to make the course intensive and difficult, but the way it was chosen, transforms the course into an epic failure. Summary: if you are looking to gather knowledge, stay away from this specialization. There are plenty of free courses with deep explanations, addressing modern techniques, and correct code PAs, under the same limitations: you are alone, no TAs or colleagues to be asked. (e.g., https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-20/lectures.html, by March 2021). If it happens that the specialization is paid by the company you are working for, then go ahead, but keep in mind that you are alone. If it is no, do not waste time and money. I have finished the specialization with honors (almost 100%). Still, I am deeply disappointed. The two stars are given due to Daphne.",2

I took statistics at uni and this was a refresher on the specialisation track but the way Bayes' rule was covered made me doubt what I knew.

Also, the concepts are elaborated on a seemingly random basis. Mean is left at ""center of mass"" like we just came out of physics 101 but the area under a curve is dragged out with random wood cutting analogies.

This course is a good example of how to design a bad online course and teach a complex material so it's more difficult to understand. I'd give other courses a shot instead of this one, unless you want the specialization.
First, the course should have listed R programming as a prerequisite. Second, instead of only reading the definition of terms, he should have explained what they are and give example. I spent more than 4x of the video lecture length, trying to think and follow, but I still didn't understand. No example, no explanation, just *reading* the definition right off the text book using mathematical term. Math is complex, but it can be explained so everyone can understand. Third, I simply have a hard time understanding why the professor has to talk so fast and edit his video and/or make slides so text pops up in order to speed up the lecture instead of writing along as he speaks and explains (but there was no explanation in the lecture anyway so pausing the video to slow down wouldn't help).

1597,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Dasarathan S,"Feb 13, 2020","It is one of the most important courses in Data Science. It covers most of the mathematical portion and it is hard as well for a non-mathematical student. 
For a minimum, every sentence will have any of the four words like distribution, sample, probability, variance, mean, median, standard deviation, etcetera. We have to spend enough time and to be very careful in understanding each and every sentence.
But this course was nicely categorized by Brian Caffo  & others, This presentation was the simplest one on probability & statistics, I ever saw and it covers majority of the basic concepts.
Thanks to Brian Caffo, Roger D. Peng & Jeff Leek.",5
1598,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Prahlad P,"May 8, 2020","Initially it seemed all Greek and Latin and difficult to go through. With patience and slowly going through the course material again and again things started becoming easy and interesting. Now I do understand the importance of statistical modeling and how to predict the population behavior.  I have learnt a lot to apply the linear regression, confidence intervals, t-testing, poison and binomial testing, and the p-values.  All in all a very good experience and the Coursera team has been a great help.",5
1599,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Yusuf E,"May 21, 2018","At this point in the specialization, I was really worn out by the effort that I needed to put into this course (I solved the homework questions too). While I have no problem with the math, some topics like power should not even have been discussed or should have just been discussed in passing. Caffo spent a whole week on that. After taking the Applied Data Science in Python Specialization, I have a feeling like this course and Regression Models can just be merged, while logistics regression could just be transferred to the machine learning course. 
Fortunately, the final assignment was very easy compared to the previous courses and one could finish it reasonably in a day (Reproducible Research final assignment itself took me almost a week) .",4
1600,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Moshe P,"Sep 24, 2019",Very difficult course even for someone who had learnt Mathematics and Statistic at the University level. Many concepts were very tersely explained with very few examples. The course book definitely helped. I would say two semesters of Statistics were squeezed into this course. Homework work exercises were very interesting and interactive.,3
1601,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Supharerk T,"Mar 8, 2016","I get this course since I really want to learn on boosting. However, I think the course pace is too fast and should be include more 'non-greece symbol'. I have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but I'm still having a hard time understanding lecture. I would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization (practical machine learning is much easier than this). I bet many students will have a problem in this course since it's a 'beginner' level specialization.
My suggestion is to 'slow down' , expand the lecture with more drawing/picture explanation, more r coding and get rid of those greece-symbol as much as possible. ",2
1602,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Christoph G,"Sep 13, 2016","I have to admit, that most of the videos confused more than they helped. For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course.  I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them. IN KhanAcademy e.g. they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formular wasn't such a big thing anymore.",2
1603,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Javier R,"Apr 30, 2020","Previous courses in the specialization did a very good job in relating reality vs. theory. This particular course provided great amounts of mathematical theory to support learning, however, in my opinion fails to guide the student to relate real life cases with the theory, making it harder to understand and thus not as useful as it should have been.

I understand that are so many contents to present, but jumping around from one to another is not the way.
Quite frequently a lot of the slides are just useless. Not all of us have the time to go behind every mathematics, so I would like to see more real examples of how to use the contents you teach us, than knowing all the mathematics and have a lot of slides to show how to deduct mathematically the probability of something to happen.

Good for people who want a summary of all the statistical concepts you can use for data science. You'll get the most out of this course not by expecting it to be beginner, because it is not.

However, if you are a complete beginner I highly recommend first doing a basic statistics course (such as the one presented by the University of Amsterdam on coursera). Also, do use the recommended textbook and take your time to understand concepts. This course will also work better in context of other courses in the Data Science specialisation (for example R Programming and Exploratory Data Analysis).

I didn't have time to watch the lectures and also do the practice exercises in Swirl in the time allotted. As usual, the time estimates for completion are wonky.  I ended up just watching the lectures and taking the tests, which is far from ideal (I am taking some time to do those valuable exercises now that the course is done).  Although I got 100% in the course, I felt the learning experience could have been better as a result.",4

1620,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Jared P,"Apr 11, 2017","I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my 6th course.  All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great.  But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.
First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews.  I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.
One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course.  They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case.  Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.  
Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...
For the record, I almost aced this course.  The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it.  I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.
The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst.  I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities).  Then I couldn't get motivated.  1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off.  Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks.  The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible).  The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.
(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).
If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course.  For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more.  Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours.  Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon  (My partner was not pleased). 
Now here is where things get awkward.  I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars.  It accomplished something that some University courses could not.  I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems.  So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?
Would I take the course again?  I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification.  If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn.  In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.
If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?  
So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars.  If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority.  If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.  ",3
1621,Statistical Inference by Johns Hopkins University,Andrew,"May 5, 2019","Not my favorite course in the series, but I did learn a lot. I highly recommend following along with the course book provided in the course. The videos alone are not enough. I also recommend printing out a sheet with statistical formulas to use (not provided from the course, but you can find easily on the web). The stat sheet with formula helped me connect all the dots and better understand when to use a formula. ",3

I don't know if it's the pain of switching to the new platform or what, but the total lack of any support from the TA/instructor team is frustrating.

Several of the videos have blatant errors in them, like the fast that the fourth video of a week also contains the entire third video... again.
Such things should not have passed a half decent QA test.
More than anything this specialization should not be marketed as ""no previous experience needed"". You need to know some statistics. And by some, I mean do the whole thing on Khan Academy first. ",2

I have a PhD degree in Stem, and had taken statistics courses during my undergraduate, and also had some teaching experience. I can't believe they can made a course like this quality. It downgrades the reputation of the department of biostatistics at the JHU. I saw some criticizing comments before I took the course, but I thought it would be OK and I would get through it. But after taking two weeks' courses, I just feel so frustrated and furious and can't help to write down my comments. 
The format of this course is like, first, read out the parameter, and then read out the notation, without giving any explanation about how to calculate this out, why we want to introduce this parameter, and how we use this parameter. And then the instructor gives an example, but I don't see any of the examples emphasize the notions. 
I just can't help to write down my comments. I don't want to give even one star to this course!!!!! Such a shame. 
There should be some teaching centers at the JHU where some teaching professionals can help to improve the structure of these courses and give instructions about how to deliver the contents organically. I beg you to have some improvements.",1

A lot of the concepts, although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day, I felt it were really difficult to understand at first.  Wikipedia and some other online sources, and youtube videos, were more helpful but I think the real issue lay in the teaching style.

Brian Caffo is the best instructor of the dozens of classes I've taken online.   He is a little challenging at times, but that is what makes him such a good teacher.

When considering this course we need to separate the subject (which is fascinating) and the tools (which seem quite powerful) from the course itself. I had really high hopes during the lectures in week 1, where the videos are stronger and close to a well taught university lecture than others in the specialisation. However the assignments and the autograder issues are too great to ignore! Assignments are poorly worded (in one question it is literally trial and error) and the autograder often breaks. There are cases of people spending 10+ hours on work getting incredibly frustrated by the lack of feedback to find out the solutions were correct and the autograder was playing up. ",1

But this course seems lack of systematic structure of building the knowledge, it just walked through the topics quickly and extensively. I had to spend a few hours to learn about the whole structure of text mining to build in-depth knowledge, more than 20 hours to watch the online nltk & genism tutorials cause i m new to text mining & nlp. 
just hope the course can simplify the complicated topics such as where we are in the whole process, what's it, why we need it, working theory, coding, how we use these parameters, etc. to make life easier. ",1

1791,Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan,David C,"Aug 8, 2017","I really wanted to like this course, and there were some redeeming features, but overall I'm unable to recommend it in its current state.  IMO, the lectures were at much too high a level while the programming assignments were very detailed with vague instructions and little guidance.  There was no link between what was discussed in class and how the fine details of the assignments were to be understood.  In addition, the course was published with errors in the auto-grader and no resources in the Resources link (not even slide decks from the lectures, so to review material you were forced to re-visit all the recorded lectures which was very inefficient).   My recommendation to Coursera and the Univ of Michigan is to completely re-do the course, doubling the number of lectures to provide not just the broad overview of the topics, but also some detailed descriptions of recommended ways to implement what was discussed.   I would also recommend using Professor Andrew Ngs Machine Learning course as a guide for how to create great programming assignments, with detailed PDFs (typically 5-6 pages) describing what is to be done AND WHY (linking back to the lectures) and ""telling a story"" that is cohesive and leads the student to create something end-to-end (in small steps) that does something amazing by the end.  The programming assignments in this course seemed, in contrast, to be a shotgun blast of ""do this"", ""create this"", ""make this happen"" with little context of how the small pieces fit together or what the overall goal of the assignment is to accomplish -- and at the end, a feeling of ""I passed the autograder's expections, but have no idea what I've really done or why"".  There were so many great things that could have been done with the Text Mining topic, and this course touched on just a few in a very haphazard way that simply left me confused and wondering why I spent so much time to learn so little.

The assignments also suffer from ambiguity and sometimes outright forgetting of explicit instructions. Moreover, workbook-type examples are often lacking. Although I'm very disappointed in the execution of this class, there is potential if these problems are addressed.

But the quality of this course on text mining is far below the average level of the first three. Go find some other courses if you want to learn text mining with Python. 
There are too many areas of flaws in this course. I am only highlighting the top 5 below: 
1. lacks good connection throughout the course content. This problem exists almost everywhere, both from slide to slide within a video and from video to video. Many times you would have questions in your head like “why is he talking about this?” or “what is this?”
2. use example just for the purpose of showing examples. Don’t really explain the point it is supposed to explain. In many times the examples do not provide clarity, but raise more confusion instead. 
3. assignment tasks either too simple, or remotely related to what is introduced in the course. The worst case is assignment in week 4, where the assignment is so poorly constructed. You have to spent days to figure out the right answer. They call it “debug”, but there is nothing wrong with my code. I would say it is more of a process to “try to figure out what the instructor is asking for”.  
4. talks too much about the theoretical things, not very good introduction of using python. Even when python code is demonstrated, it is almost always in a very abstract way. This is significantly different from the first three courses, and very annoying. You would need to spend about the same amount of time googling how the packages work as I have never took the course. 
5. Repetition of content already introduced in previous courses, i.e., machine learning basics. ",1

In the first week, the code and outputs were provided, but as the course progresses, they are not provided anymore. I would have really helped to actually see the outputs and follow along with a jupyter notebook code. 
However the reason why I am giving this course 2 stars is because of the assignments. The assignments were really a pain in the neck. Yes, the assignments help you learn, but it gets really frustrating when the autograder doesn't work properly. Most of the time the autograder grades incorrectly. In week 3, some of the solutions were marked incorrect when the solutions are actually correct. Instead of accepting the correct solutions, the autograder accepts the incorrect solutions as ""correct"" solutions. The autograder doesn't give much feedback on why the solution is incorrect. 
In addition to the autograder, the assignments themselves don't guide you. The were so many additional things we had to do to pass the assignments. There were so many hidden tests that we were not aware of. And the assignments don't help guide us on how to pass those hidden tests. Week 1 and Week 3 assignments were so frustrating because of these issues.

The autograder during the third week is broken and won't accept answers that are correct but are of the wrong data type or which got rounded to 10e-11 as a result of the order of operations in the code. The mentor is MIA. Bad data science practices (like not scaling data) are tacitly encouraged (""just follow the instructions and don't add steps"" says the Mentor) and sometimes you have to pass the wrong numbers to a function in order for the autograder to work.

The autograder is frequently breaking for very minor things (such as returning numpy.float instead of float), the questions on the assignments are often misleading, poorly worded, vague, or just generally not very helpful. All in all, this was one of the worst MOOCs I have ever taken, though the Coursera bar is pretty low. It does make me wonder why I bother to pay at all--oh right, Coursera now makes not paying a major inconvenience to course progression.",1
1844,Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan,Guo X W,"Jun 21, 2020",This is my least favourite course in the specialisation. Natural language processing is an exciting field and I think there is a lot more potential to enthuse and engage students. The instructor scratches the surface of text mining by going through brief sets of codes on ppt slides. I thought it would be meaningful to use more real-world datasets (as in the previous courses in the specialisation) and have students follow through some examples on Jupyter Notebook. I also felt that the exposition by the instructor was not the most intuitive or lucid. It could be much clearer.,1
1845,Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan,Will W,"May 21, 2021","While containing marginally less bugs and errors than previous courses in the specialization (though they are still present and bafflingly U of M shows no interest in ever fixing them), this course spends too much time going over topics already covered in previous courses, then shifts to a very simplistic and rudimentary overview of the material at hand. The last week especially is so rushed that I don't feel I have a solid grasp on what was supposed to be taught, and the assignment is just paint-by-numbers reading of documentation and plugging in guesses.",1
1846,Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan,Matt P,"Apr 12, 2020","This course was much less helpful than others in the Specialization. The assignments are poorly conceived, and submissions are beset by finicky autograder issues. Certainly, data cleaning and code debugging are critical skills for text mining, but I find it difficult to believe that ""try to understand what output a function should submit so as to satisfy the current autograder"" is a useful way to teach text mining.

1847,Applied Text Mining in Python by University of Michigan,Denys P,"Aug 10, 2019","The course is a joke.

The python notebooks are robust, and are excellent examples of statistical coding.

It would have been nice to go over some non-linear regression as well as I did appreciate week 4 but I am not sure these special topics were as useful as the previous topics. Weeks 3 and 4 could have been used to dilute the content a little bit to go into multi-level regression a little bit more in depth and maybe look at non-linear regression. On a side note, I though the pdf files explaining linear regression and logistic regression as extra reading were absolutely fantastic to clear things up. I am sure the course would benefit from more content like that.",4
1917,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Ginger d R,"Jan 13, 2023","Like the other courses in this specialization, way too much theory covered, and the easy quizzes and labs give the learner a false confidence that he/she's mastering statistics. Instead, you grasp some of the theoretical knowledge, but not of the underlying math and therefore none of the intuition. The same is true of Python, all that's required is to hit the run cell button, no actual coding is required.
The lecturers are super enthusiastic though, and the final week was fantastic. Mark Kurzeja should have his own course on probability and Bayesian statistics.
Week 3 of every course has been super dense, and I think T Brady West should have his own course on sample design and weights because right now his lecturers drag down the overall quality of the course. It's all slides and text, math is brushed over and not enough of it is applied. Honestly, if you wanted to really get into Multilevel & Marginal Models you'd need 4 weeks.
My advice, take the AP statistics course on Khan academy, watch some STATSQUEST on youtube & perhaps take the intro to statistics offered by Stanford University. You can also take this course/specialization and just skip weeks 3. You can probably pass the tests anyway

Professor West does a great job focusing on the theory that one needs to know before applying any modeling, and there is quite a lot of Python material at the end that the learner will have to explore mostly on his own, since the corresponding videos are somewhat lacking in depth. Week 3, on the other hand, introduces some very interesting but advanced concepts that can be quite hard to grasp, especially for learners that haven't had much experience with classic statistical model fitting. Week 4 is mostly an introduction to Bayesian Models, but nothing deep.

Brady may speak alittle too fast, especially when it comes to long sentences, so you may need to rewind certain segments of the videos numerous times to revisit some concepts as you reflect and learn.

Discussion forums were also actively monitored by a TA who got back to me usually within a day, which helped to unblock conceptual roadblocks quickly.

You may encounter some issues with the Coursera platform:

1. Labs may fail to load at times, even after following instructions to restart the machine which your lab runs from

2. Your discussion forum comments may disappear right after you post. Remember to copy your comment somewhere else (e.g. on a notepad) as you may need to refresh the page and post your comment again.",5

That said, the course is super informative and the supporting materials are relevant to what's being discussed for the week.  I definitely plan to review some of the lectures to try and catch anything that I may have missed or just to reinforce the concepts that were presented.",5
1930,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Aayush G,"May 30, 2019","I must say that this is a must take course for ones who are aspiring a career in Data Science. All the concepts were laid out so beautifully and it was explained very clearly with visualisations of each real-life-examples. I enrolled in this specialisation before starting my Machine Learning so that I have all the necessary fundamentals of Statistics. Brady Sir & Brendra Ma'am are simply phenomenal, the way they explain the concepts are incredible. The concepts gets etched in one's memory.",4

1933,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Houtan G J,"Jul 19, 2020","This is the worst course I have ever wasted my time and patient on it. I don't understand how can a specialization with net materials including at most 30pages of pdf and 2 hours video  get stretched for 12 weeks in lengthy boring videos mostly by young students who don't have a deep understanding of what they are talking about!! just to give you how pointless this specialization is I finished the 3rd course week 3 and 4 in 5 min by just solving quizes. this specialization explains ideas and materials which are so simple that you could grasp in 2 minute if explained by a knowledgable teacher, in hours on non sense boring repetitive shallow talks. no math explained properly, no plot explained properly. there are hours of videos that TAs going through notebooks and reading the code already written with no explanation of underlying mechanisms, which could shorten the specialization by removing them. I can't understand why this specialization is popular! maybe because you can get certificate without watching anything!",1
1934,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Tamer G,"Jun 27, 2021","the focus only on statistics not python which I think is the main reason for every one who enrolled in this course, it was even too much fast for statistics and very  poor python assessment and tutorials, I don't recommend this course to any one.",1

1936,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,OSCAR A N B,"Jun 1, 2023","Desde mi punto de vista, considero que la especialización esta muy bien, sobre todo porque se refuerza de manera constante los aprendizajes teoricos, y al mismo tiempo existe la posibilidad de replicar el codigo dentro de los cuadernos de jupyter, ahora, evidentemente hay muchas cosas por mejorar, inicialmente el código ya esta depredado en muchos elementos y lo ideal sería corregir esto, también hay errores absurdos, por ejemplo dentro de los notebook hay errores y en muchas ocasiones no coincide el notebook con las explicaciones previas. En este ultimo curso, hubo un reto muy grande porque se explica que son los modelos de regresion lineal y logisticos, marginales y jerarquicos, y es un tema que desde mi punto de vista fue mucho más complejo de entender que los otros, entonces sería agradable que se incluyeran más ejemplos. No obstante, recomiendo enormemente esta especialización. Para mi tiene más cosas positivas que negativas, el foro es un mecanismo para salir de dudas y observar el avance de otros, además como ya lo mencione, creo que como aprendices necesitamos buenas bases conceptuales y esto nos ayudará a mejorar en proyectos propios o a entender otros cursos que tomemos con más facilidad.

I had been so impressed with the clear explanations, revision and review, and the opportunities to apply new knowledge. However, it all became very abstract - I thought Mark did a good job but perhaps Bayesian is a whole different specialisation. Overall, I really enjoyed the specialisation and I am pleased to have received a good grounding in statistics ahead of my Data Science diploma.

1991,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Yasin A,"Apr 17, 2020","It is a good introductory course for statistics. The programming assignments were not challenging enough to cement what you have learned. The concepts in week 3 and week 4 were challenging and their approach was not good. I feel like I wasted my time. The focus should have been on multilevel model fitting rather than covering bayesian statistics. Week 4 only added more confusion. However, as an introduction course, they did a good job of presenting the concepts in the prior courses of the specialization. ",4
1992,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Fanchen H,"Apr 4, 2021","Overall, this course clearly conveys the general ideas about model fitting. The python labs of week 2 and 3 are helpful. However, the materials for week 3 and week 4 lectures are not as good as others in this series.

Most of the course consists of lengthy video-lectures paging through slides (and occasionally walking through notebooks). The hands-on parts seem like a second thought, and are mostly made of either reading long Jupyter notebooks, or running simple pre-coded ones to answer a short quizz. Statistical modeling is a topic that shoudl naturally lend itself really well to a ""learn by doing"" method, but unfortunately this course took the more traditional academic approach (nothing wrong with the later, it's just less engaging for me, especially when sitting in front of a computer).",3
2019,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Fabian d A G,"Sep 20, 2021","The final course was definitely a step up in terms of difficulty from the previous two courses.

2020,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Anastasios B,"Dec 13, 2021","While the topics are interesting, like other courses in this specialization, this one does not really teach Python. Rather, it uses it as a tool in prepared notebooks that you can follow along with, but largely need to do your own research to understand the various syntax and variables used. This really is more of a Stats course, where the Python element doesn't add much other than some visuals of how to read results or view charts/plots using Python.

2023,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Xio L,"Feb 7, 2020",It feels like Brady is reading off the slides and squeezing in a lot of information in a 10-12 min talk.

2029,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Mikel A,"May 31, 2020","In my opinion, the course does not worth. I just complete it, as I came from the first two courses and I wanted to complete all the specialization (and I still had some days untill the deadline of the fee).
The first week is very basic. Week two, could be the most usefull if they had develope the maths behind fitting, not just a conceptual explanation. And finally weeks three and four, in my opinion, are out of the level of the course; I can't understand why to move to multivelel or Bayesian, if the basic fitting of Week2 has not been explained. In all the course, just concepts are explained, not the maths to understand in detail.
Moreover, I found too many extern lectures, apps or interviews that add little to the course.
The quiz, as in the previous course should be re-thought, I don't think are the best evaluation method. As for example, you can have wrong answer just not for running the code in Jupyter Notebook but in Spyder. Moreover, the quiz from weeks 2 and 3 about Python are ridiculous, you just have to run a code already written by the teaching stuff.",2
2030,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Ron M C,"May 1, 2020","Good job in covering the initial models, and then above average when going into the multi-level modeling, but pretty disappointed on the marginal and the bayesian.  Bayesian videos started out well, but really felt superficial when it was all done.

2031,Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python by University of Michigan,Esmail T,"Apr 28, 2024","It was irrelevant and contained unnecessary content.

2035,MLOps Platforms: Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML by Duke University,Georgi K,"Nov 11, 2023","I am subscribed to the entire specialization, so this is my third course and review and I have to say it does not disappoint. Similar to the previous 2 courses the video order from the very beginning is messed up. We are shown the most basic of operations – how to start an AWS cloud shell and split your screen but more complex things are brushed off with just a link to the AWS documentation. The course still has no  structure, honestly, I do not know what the whole point is, what are we working towards. The quizzes got even worse, and the number of questions was reduced from 10 to 5 to 1 with some absurd questions like what is EDA, why perform feature engineering. Course 3 of 4 of an Advanced Level specialization keeps explaining structured vs unstructured machine learning; train, test splits etc beginner topics. I do not recommend taking this course or the entire specialization even if you get them for free. ",1

Also, the structure of the course was quite confusing.  Things would not be explained at all until suddenly something we've already been talking about for 1 or 2 weeks was explained in week 4.  This was a very frustrating and difficult course for someone who isn't already in the MRI field.

One suggestion for improvement I have is that a cheat-sheet or catalogue of sorts be provided within the course, which collates all the coding and syntax from the course onto one single space.
This is especially helpful while taking up the course as part of the specialization series. It isn't easy to remember precise code syntax after just one or two uses of a function. As I progressed through the courses in the specialization, I found myself having to return to previous courses and comb through the hands-on labs to retrieve specific codes, functions and syntaxes. This was time-consuming and wasteful, and can easily be remedied by a list of codes (with syntax) used in an entire course.

2197,Designing Autonomous AI by University of Washington,Mark V,"Oct 19, 2022","STILL needs LOTS of work - ""plays"" like a v1.0 course, and all that this implies: 
- myriad typos (multiple on every page, every question of every quiz) 
- lack of consistency in (brand new) nomenclature; this will be a huge PAIN POINT for all students who are trying to wrap their heads around the new lingo, even while the instructor is using multiple terms DIFFERENTLY or even INTERCHANGEABLY (note: I've kept screenshots, and have several DOZEN to share upon request) 
- an almost complete ignorance of (60 YEARS' WORTH) of existing Control System Theory into which this Autonomous AI 'control theory' simply MUST fit, NOT replace. This results in all the ""theory"" and ""nomenclature"" diagrams coming off as sort of half-baked; they ATTEMPT to resemble rigorous, well-thought-out Control System Theory diagrams, but then you realize they're completely MISSING key components required in EVERY Control System diagram - stuff like the SYSTEM or PLANT itself, so that the resulting diagram simply has MAGICAL ""inputs"" and ""outputs"" without the diagrams actually EXPLAINING FROM WHERE THESE INPUTS & OUTPUTS COME 
- an annoyingly-regular practice of asking QUIZ QUESTIONS about contents that - in fact - was REMOVED from the lesson itself (I have screenshots to prove this statement) 
This course would benefit from a professional instructor re-writing/re-designing the entire course from ground up; as-is it's about 80% ""GREAT"", but the 20% that's missing/confused/intermixed/redefined knocks what could be an A+ can't-wait-for-the-next-lesson course down to the C+ that it deserves as a ""v1.0"" course. 

I predict that - with the right help - by this time next year this course rises up to the A+ it has the POTENTIAL of becoming :-) ",2

It is up to par and even beyond professional options that charge thousands of dollars for a 40 hour, 1 week course. Professor Dunn even offers a free coursebook to complement his excelent lectures, which goes well beyond the intensive 5-6 weeks period. Uses R for programming and gives just the necessary snippets of code needed to complete every exercise and quiz. Plenty of real-life examples and a succinct style makes this course your only stop to understand DOE and then go on your own. Statistics are not needed, but having a previous background will help you appreciate even more the quality and effort put in every lecture. Two words of advice: 1 ) Take notes, as every video is full of little details. 2 ) It is the entry-level DOE course, seasoned experimenters will finish all units in 1 or 2 weeks.",5

I would only remark that there are quite a few language mistakes in this course (and I am not even a native speaker). For example:
data are, not 'Data is' because 'data' is a plural noun;
The course talks about weight, while the exact term is mass (weight
is expressed in Newton, mass in kg).

2490,Big Data Modeling and Management Systems by University of California San Diego,Hendrik B,"Dec 17, 2017","Sorry, but I don't think this is a very good course. Here are some reasons why: The time said to be needed for the course is artificially increased, because there are ten minutes appraised for each set of lecture slides. At the end, there is almost no reading material, which is not obvious when looking at the course at the start. I think this is almost fraud. Ultimately, there are basically only lectures, no other media to learn, except for some multiple-choice quizzes. There are Coursera courses which are way more diverse. Additionally, the lectures are not particularly good (not speaking of the horrible design and colouring). Especially, when talking about some examples for BDMS, it is difficult to follow because some of the concepts have not been explained properly prior to that. The quizzes are not very good, and it is very obvious that there is not much thought behind the answer options. Also, for the quizzes you almost exclusively need to memorize learned stuff, but not to transfer knowledge or to apply knowledge). The final exam was a joke, because there was NO attempt by the supervisors to give students some intuition about the right answers after they submitted. Still, they were expected to rate others’ submissions. Meaning, when you didn't know how to answer a question, you were still expected to rate others submissions. Seriously?  In general, so far it feels like the lecturers attempted to make a shallow course for a big topic, meaning big data, in order to get some money (after all: it is expensive to earn a course certificate). There are courses on other topics (e.g. “Game Theory” by Stanford University, where the quizzes are relatively hard but you get a feeling that you learn something, “Improving your statistical inferences” by Eindhoven University, which has many different media to learn, not just lectures, and has exceptionally good quizzes, as well as “Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis” by Santa Cruz University, which has very modern style of presenting the lecture). Sorry, but I think this course needs improvement, especially since the topic is so important.

2491,Big Data Modeling and Management Systems by University of California San Diego,Massimo M,"Jan 28, 2018","Sorry to say, but the course's topics are superficially explained. Teacher provided an overwhelming quantity of concept at the speed of  light with very few practical examples. The entire course is not very explicative for someone that is not already a subject matter expert (that any case would define this course no more than a quick review). The assignment requirements are unclear and, in my opinion, teacher has not sufficiently explained the concepts required in order to straightforwardly perform it. More over, the assignment requires to use tables and graph, but the learning platform embedded editor does not allow to design this kind of graphical elements.",1

I have used lucene at work both directly and wrapped within elastic search: in both cases I was not going deep in understanding the data model behind lucene and concepts like similarity. You can leave like that in the vast majority of the current jobs where lucene is a third party system invoked upon needs but understanding the model behind was simply much more easy than I expected.

How do the different tests relate to each other? Etc. It feels like this course needed an extra 50-60 minutes of lecture time to tie all these concepts together. A textbook to follow along would have been great too.",3
2615,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Mikel A,"May 29, 2020","Dissapointing. Full of errors during all the course. I came from the first course and I found the second one dissapointing. Some issues I found I thonk they should solve:
*The assessments have no sense. Which is the sense of asking if 0 or 1 corresponds to napping or not napping from a datasheet? In general I also found myself wasting a lot of time trying to understand the definition of columns of NHANES or other datasheets which I think is useless. In overall I found that the assessments do not evaluate the progress of the student.
*The assessments sometimes are not related to the concepts explained during the week (Name that scenario) or in the case of Pythos quiz ask for unexplained functions (week 3).
*Some assignements, like the Chocoloate assignement, are about previously not explained concepts (cross-over test desing). 
*The Jupyter Notebook have several errors, reported in the discussion forums but not solved. Moreover, some parts of the code shown are not explained. And finally, the way to solve a problem is different in the explanation video and notebook; this is very confusing for the student.
*Week 3 explains several times the same concept (CI and p_value) but them skip to explain the Power or SampleSize in detail, which are just mentioned in a Jupyter Python notebook. Moreover, I found missing a detailed explained on when to use z_test or t_test; I would had dedicate some time to this explanations, and less to repeat the same CI and p_value examples over and over. 
*Week 4, is just a review of week 3. I like the way Brady T. West explains the concepts, but once agains I found extremely repetitive showing so many examples of the CI and p_value.",2
2616,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Tobias R,"Feb 26, 2019","Alltogether the course was great. I learned so much and understood some principles I did not understand when having read of them before.
However in some notebooks, calculations were wrong or notbooks were missing alltogether (week 4, last jupyter notebook). Furthermore it can be annoying if you cannot trust a result of a statistical analysis in a notebook because there were other mistakes before. That's why I give you ""only"" 4/5 stars. ",4
2617,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Iver B,"Feb 5, 2019","Very clear and interesting lectures, but quizzes and Jupyter notebooks could benefit from some additional proofreading and pre-release testing.  Material in last week is out of order.   Spent a few hours some week just figuring out the mistakes with the help of the course forum.
Also, I would have liked to have a bit more background and explanation, e.g. information on why we using a particular distribution or a particular test, not just how.  While a complete derivation of all the material would clearly be out of scope, other courses did a better job of introducing the theory behind their methods.",3

2619,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Danny R,"Mar 22, 2019","Good lectures but too little practice and quizzes that don't cover all the material. Very little Python. 
No lecture slides or ""handouts"" to summarize procedures or formulae that tend to jumble together for the various scenarios you learn. Some of the lectures told us to find tables needed to do the quizzes online, no more specifications. That was very disappointing.",3
2620,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Michael D,"May 29, 2019","This course is a good statistics course, but a poor Python course. Python is practically an after thought in each week's lesson as the focus in the lecturing learning methods is entirely verbal rather than supported by in lecture use of Python. The Python review at the end of each week before the assessment is not connected enough with the lecture materials and makes for a very disjointed week of learning.",2
2621,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,José A G P,"Apr 16, 2019","The course contents are good to an introduction or refreshing in statistics but the assigments are not really well prepared, and contains many unrepaired errors. This drops down the level an educational potential of this course (and the entire specialization) and converts it in a poor educational resource and a  waste of time, in my opinion",1
2622,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Aayush G,"Apr 26, 2019","I must say that this is a must take course for ones who are aspiring a career in Data Science. All the concepts were laid out so beautifully and it was explained very clearly with visualisations of each real-life-examples. I enrolled in this specialisation before starting my Machine Learning so that I have all the necessary fundamentals of Statistics. Brady Sir & Brendra Ma'am are simply phenomenal, the way they explain the concepts are incredible. The concepts gets etched in one's memory. ",5
2623,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Sagar T,"Jan 6, 2020","From the introduction, the course is supposed to build the knowledge ground up for a beginner in Statistics. However, it falls short in clearing many concepts and the principals end up being vague in a lot of sense, hence, there is a lack of cohesiveness in the concepts spread across weeks. Fortunately, I took an open course offered by Stanford University of the Inference Concepts explained in this course; before taking up this course.
Overall, this is a good course for someone who is familiar with the Inference concepts. For a beginner, a significant amount effort would be required to catch up to these concepts.",2
2624,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Diaconescu T,"Dec 7, 2021","I found it a lot more interesting than the first one. Better examples, better structure.
My only complain: I do realize that week 4 was meant to be as an overview of the course, but... the structure of week 4 is much much more clear than for the 1-3 week. I for one, wish i watched week 4 first.
Why i say that ... because the examples were all over the place... at some point i wasn't sure if i was supposed to use a t-test or a z-test. Some examples were repeating themselves throughout the course. Sometimes the code presented in the video was not the same as the one present in the lab files. 
I can say that at the end of first 3 weeks...i understood almost everything there is about the inferential aspect of statistics...but... the python part was a complete mess. After week 4  & this: 
Statistics 350 – Formula Sheet (umich.edu)
 ... everything became clear. The link should be provided in the course... I stumbled on it by accident in the forum section.  ",5

En este curso numero 2 me falto que hubieramos podido tocar el tema de regresión lineal. Ahora, los cuadernos de práctica frente a algunos ejemplos de los videos no concuerdan, o se simplifican a tal manera que en muchas ocasiones no hay coherencia frente al código que plantean y frente a la misma explicación. Frente a eso lo más importante es que podamos realizar los ejercicios y el procedimiento completo utilizando python, y luego facilitar el trabajo mediante los modulos. En general si es un curso que recomendaría, me parece que fue bastante robusto y hubo bastante repaso de los temas de intervalos de confianza, estadística t y z y pruebas de hipotesis. ",4
2630,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Vu M D,"Aug 8, 2022","Useful course to learn basic concepts of inferential statistical analysis. However, I would expect more Python exercises/assignments than the essay-type writing assignment.",4
2631,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Colby G,"Jan 22, 2022",Course focuses more on the mathmatical side without getting too far into much of any programming.

2633,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Bhanu P P,"Jun 28, 2020","There are no feedbacks for wrong answers in QUIZ, of course the course and the quiz are not at all relatable, lol",3
2634,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Kaiquan M,"Jan 8, 2022","This ""Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python"" course went in depth into the topics of confidence interval and hypothesis testing in ways that were not covered in school.

You will learn how to perform hypothesis tests for key areas such as :
1. (Single) population mean
2. (Single) population proportion
3. Difference in proportions
4. Difference in means for paired data
5. Difference in means for independent observations/groups

The course covered lecture videos, well-prepared readings, Jupyter notebooks to introduce concepts as well as practice notebooks, lab walkthroughs, written assignment and quizzes. Brady may speak alittle too fast, especially when it comes to long sentences, so you may need to rewind certain segments of the videos numerous times to revisit some concepts as you reflect and learn.

Through the Jupyter notebooks, you will better understand challenges when working with datasets and the nuances of how to perform these hypothesis tests in real life, compared to ""sampling design and hypothesis testing"" on paper (back in school in the past).

The discussions forums was also actively monitored by a TA who got back to me usually within a day, which helped to unblock conceptual roadblocks quickly.

You may encounter some issues with the Coursera platform:
1. Labs may fail to load at times, even after following instructions to restart the machine which your lab runs from
2. Your discussion forum comments may disappear right after you post. Remember to  copy your comment somewhere else (e.g. on a notepad) as you may need to refresh the page and post your comment again.",5
2635,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Bryan M,"May 24, 2020","They could increase the rigor mathematically on this OR spend more time on creative code.  Code was great.  Math was very very easy so you don't have to listen to the videos if you don't want and just grab the lecture slides.  I find on many of these courses they are either way too rigorous or not rigorous at all where the lectures are a bit of waste and you can just read the books/slides  (Sounds like Undergrad math/stats lectures all over again? aha) 
HIGHLY Recommend course if anything for the CODE  in the notebooks.  If you're just getting back up to speed on Pandas I found that these helped with sorting the data and reminding you of the difference of built in methods for stats with pandas and numpy.
Laslty, I did not like that only 3 people grading the assignment if we are going to do this crowd sourced grading.  I found one grader in particular didn't understand what a p-value was and marked me down and another from the previous course didn't have a handle on english enough to understand what I was writing on my memo.  
That said thank you for the course.",5
2636,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Paul P,"Jan 1, 2021","This course went into great detail about how to calculate confidence intervals and p-values, what these mean statistically, and some cautionary tales and misconceptions regarding them. It was really repetitive, which I appreciated, as it really drills the concepts in, but if you really catch on quickly to mathematical concepts you might find this a bit annoying. The applications with Python are quite useful - the course goes into detail not only with how to manually input values, but encourages you to write your own functions and ultimately access the statsmodels library to simplify this. It's nice to know what's going on under the hood in the libraries we so often depend on.",5
2637,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Mark S,"Oct 28, 2021","Fantastic!  I really liked how the course showed the groups of tests (one test, paired test, difference) and then bucketed it by proportions vs means.  I also really liked how the course tied hypothesis testing with confidence intervals to really get a sense of how it all ties together. 
The python piece is good.  I have some experience with python and pandas, so I was ok.  Not sure how easy it would be if you have never worked with python before.  Then again, the creators of the course state that you should have some familiarity with python.",5

2731,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Jerrold,"Nov 19, 2020","I really don't see the reason for all the hate for this course and the specialization. 
Pros:
Robust syllabus on statistics and mathematics that covers all the important concepts in inferential stats 
Ample example python notebook files for students to reference
High quality lectures and content
Manageable assignments and quizzes
Lots of guided examples (week4) and excellent readings written by UoM on statistics and data analysis theory and practices.
Student forum support from lecturers is excellent
Cons (minus 1 star):
While the material in this course is good, we should be given some notes with formulas and diagrams to accompany us at the start of week 2 and 3 (the hardest ones)
A person without a background in python will struggle in this specialization because you need to have programing skill and experience and the introductory practices are not enough.
You need to have some prior experience with stats or a pre-college/college year 1 text book to accompany you if this is your first time learning stats. The start-middle phase content at each chapter is explained and NOT skipped, but it could use more elaboration. I had to source elsewhere on the internet for the gaps in my knowledge (which were easily found). It is just missing a few elementary level explanations (how to calculate P values and what tests to use in different scenarios) to understand the more complex topics. I learned hypothesis testing in high school and had to refer to my textbooks for a few explanations and diagrams.
Summary:
Very satisfied with this course for what I got out of it, I gained multiple skills and a lot of familiarity with theory and examples.",4
2732,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Matteo L,"Apr 5, 2020","Just like the other two courses of this specialization I believe the content offered here is great and the main methods used for statistical inference are well explained and even possibly more important, the interpretation of results is really hammered home here which is great. A few things that weren't covered thoroughly enough (if at all) in my opinion are QQplots (maybe this is more related to course 1...) and Chi-square tests (what are they and when do we use them?). Also it would have been nice to take a little bit more time to explain the differences in using t-tests and z-tests and why we would choose one over the other. I do believe the structure of the notebooks could be improved, maybe listing all of the possible functions that can be used for statistical inference for each type of scenario (e.g. functions applicable for mean of population proportion).  As always, I would have loved for answers to be provided for the ""extra practice"" notebooks.",4
2733,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,CARLOS M V R,"Sep 1, 2020","This course gives a lot of important concepts such as confidences intervals, p-values and hypothesis testing, but I think it is short in terms of using it in real life because the explanations rely on examples that always fulfil the same conditions and in real life it is not possible to have always the same conditions for a problem you want to study. It would be nice if the course could be complemented (in a deep way) with applications of complex samples and non-probability samples, not only single random sample. Also, python codes are not explained in a deep way.",4
2734,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Wenlei Y,"Dec 18, 2019","The teaching team is great. But the assignments are not very helpful. And yes, this is more a statistics course than a python course. The application with python, which I am more interested in, seems just the supplementary portions to the lectures of concepts of statistics. There is not much introduction to how we use python to perform statistics, how we debug, and how we interpret the outcomes of programs.",4
2735,Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python by University of Michigan,Hwanmun K,"Feb 23, 2020","It would be better to give precise definitions of each test, at least in optional reading material.  Also, sometimes different lecturers used different terminologies and sometimes concepts not covered before just popped up in the video (ex. chi-square test). In general, it seems more organization in the material needed.",4
2736,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Yatin M,"Oct 13, 2017","In general, great course. But because of the strong interest in ML, I am going to attempt a detailed review.
PROS: 
This course truly de-mystifies ""Machine Learning"". After completing the course, you will be able to programmatically use 100s of ML algorithms that have been created by others over the years. You will be able to use the Caret package in R to simplify your application, simplify pre-processing, perform automatic cross-validation/model tuning and generate various statistics about the model used by your ML algorithm. You will be able to easily estimate out-of-sample accuracy to determine if your model has any hope of working well, picking one classifier over the other, or using several classifiers to estimate outcome. You will learn how some of the heavily used algorithms in the industry work behind the scenes, and where to go to learn more about these. Several learning databases are introduced. If you tinker with them, you will be amazed at how easy R and Caret make it to apply ML algorithms. You will understand how chatbots, recommender systems, spam filters, ""prediction"" systems and the like work.
WHAT THIS COURSE DOES NOT COVER:
It does not cover how to write your own ML algorithms. That requires working knowledge of optimization algorithms, advanced math and probably lots of other resources. 
WHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE?
Only those prepared to work hard, dig in, and persevere through a lot of (sometimes difficult) material will benefit from this course. If you're not confident about your statistics concepts, not comfortable with R and databases, not comfortable with googling for parameters and techniques not directly discussed in class slides, then you will have trouble. Passing the quizes require you to refer to material from prior weeks, read online documents and look for similar solutions at stackexchange etc. 
TIP FOR MENTORS:
For every week of the course, create a pinned post which says ""Tips/Errata for Quiz #n"". You've collected sufficient feedback from students now and know what the common issues are. Don't make them search through 100s of discussions to figure out solutions to well-known/common problems.",5
2737,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Thomas G,"Jun 7, 2017","By far the laziest course set up in the track. It's an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any ""practicals"" in this ""Practical Machine Learning"".

2738,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Bernie P,"Aug 7, 2018",It needs to be updated.

The quizzes are full of typos, not clear at all, and the videos teach nothing, always refering to elements of statistical learning book.

2745,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Mariah B,"Apr 7, 2020",I have taken nearly all the courses in the Data Science Certificate and this course was awful. The quizzes didn't work.  The examples required datasets that are inaccessible. The assignments expect students to be able to do things that are not covered in the rest of the class.,1

2747,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Erick M A,"Aug 18, 2017",That's a pretty rushed course. I think you really should reformulate it and discuss its content with a deeper way.,1
2748,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Wayne H,"Jun 27, 2017","I'm a big fan of the John's Hopkins Data Science series on Coursera; however, they definitely ""phoned it in"" on this particular course.  No practical assignments except for the quizzes and final course project.  Too much deference to outside materials, i.e. if you really want to learn these concepts take Andrew Ng's class or read The Elements of Statistical Learning.  The video lectures just breeze over the concepts and leave too much for the learner to just go and figure out.  The quizzes, instead of testing your knowledge are literal the only practical learning in whole class.  The course project is what you make of it.  ",1

2751,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Don M,"Jul 16, 2019","A fast-paced course that got me going in building models and understanding the pitfalls. I felt the directions for the final project were somewhat poorly worded  and vague (and calling one of the files test when it was not to be used for testing the model was initially confusing), but overall it was good. I would have liked to have seen the final project uploaded as a secure file as has been done in other courses, and Github was a poor platform for viewing html files.  Additionally, the question about out of sample error caused many people problems in the projects as they confused it with with Accuracy, yet it was weighted heavily in the rubric: I'd like the instructors to review the materials how that material is presented in terms of models. I got 100%, but as always you have to pay very close attention to the rubric. 
As always with this specialization, you are really just given a taste and there is no way you can fully explore all the material and references presented., but it is enough to get you going and wanting to come back and explore the material more. ",5
2752,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Warren B,"Feb 19, 2017","Really enlightening!   It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use!   The code actually works!   I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!
You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference.

The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for.  Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at.  Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.

2763,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Humberto R,"Feb 13, 2018",I was rather disappointed with this course. I guess it fills the objective of getting you using the caret package and getting you started with some examples. However to understand what you are doing you should defintively go somewhere else. I definitively missed some swirl exercises and more flow diagrams in the slides. It felt for me as I was just copypasting some code from the slides. The course does clearly give some good literature and places to go for details.,2
2764,Practical Machine Learning by Johns Hopkins University,Megan P,"Apr 23, 2021","This course is out of date.  The videos and books are better than many Coursera classes, but I found the quizzes and projects to be a giant time suck because required packages need certain versions of R or are no longer maintained or some other nonsense.

Some assignments are impossible to do since modern implementation of packages used are getting a COMPLETELY different answer.

2861,Scripting with Python and SQL for Data Engineering by Duke University,Steven K,"Apr 29, 2023","Summary: This course had some good information on how to write SQL queries and integrate SQL into python code, but does not go into enough detail in most places for it to be a great course. The assumed background knowledge for the learner seemed to change rapidly as well, with week 3 being especially disorienting after the gradual introduction of basic topics in weeks 1 and 2.
The good: Week 2 is a good introduction to SQL and the sqlite3 python library and week 4 is a pretty good introduction to mySQL; together they provide a foundation for using SQL in a variety of coding environments when working with local or network data.
The bad: Week 3 is about web scraping unstructured html, which isn't terribly related to SQL and so seemed quite out of place between the two SQL weeks. The first module focused on htmlparser, which requires an understanding of classes and inheritance to set up properly. The lessons on it breezed quickly past these complicated topics, merely showing the learner what to type rather than explaining anything. For a course that only recommends '<1 year python experience' and spent the entire first week going over basic python data structures, assuming learners know about classes and inheritance seemed an odd choice. The lesson on Scrapy/xpath was better but still lacked a lot of details on how these libraries work and why the syntax was the way it was; there was a sense of 'do it just like this and it will work' without much thought to preparing learners to understand and use these tools for any task other than the examples.",2
2862,Scripting with Python and SQL for Data Engineering by Duke University,Andrew M,"Sep 3, 2022",No interaction. The instructor often included code with no reasoning. By far the worst part of this course. ,1

2901,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Alessandro U,"Aug 31, 2022","Most probably the reason is simple: the course is not for beginners, and I am a beginner. That said, through the course I regularly found myself facing programming assignments I was not prepared enough to do from the lessons in the course. I found irrealistic that after 10 min of video one can actually write the functions of a machine learning algorithm he knows from 10 min. Sometimes the answer to parts of the programming assignments were barely (if not at all) mentioned in the videos. Of course I managed to find solutions and I ultimately finished the course (although right now I am currently waiting for what I think is a bug, to be fixed). But it took me months. I remained stuck onto problems for weeks with hints from the autograder as vague as ""did you check that the function works?"". Thinking back to when I started the course, surely too much naively, I unfortunately cannot say it matched my expectations.",2
2902,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Pratik P,"Jul 19, 2022","The course is misleading, the python part is completely neglected and the assignments is not properly decribed to be able to perform.

2903,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Vishal P,"Jun 16, 2022",I would not recemmend this course.

Overall my experience on Coursera has been positive and most instructors have been outstanding. This is not one of those courses.  I'm giving this course 1 star because of the lack of actual teaching , the poorly constructed programming assignments, and the absence of any response from staff in the discussion forums. There are many other better machine learning classes on Coursera and I know this because I've used them to learn the material inadequately covered in this course. If your style of learning is to take a list of topics and then go off and teach yourself everything you need to know so you can struggle through poorly designed homework assignments on your own with no one to answer  questions, then you'll enjoy this class. If not, there are plenty of other options.  ",1
2906,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Nathan H,"Apr 5, 2022","The auto-graded assignments in this course offer much better feedback than some of the other CU Boulder MS-DS courses that I've taken but they still have issues with confusing, incomplete, or incorrect instructions and cryptic feedback. 
There's a lot of good material in the course.  The coverage seems pretty basic, but that's fine.   The last section (i.e. week) which deals with support vector machines doesn't hold together as well as the rest of the course.
The course contains peer graded assignments which are fine in principle, but it seems like Coursera will only let me do the required ""grading"" part of them when the deadline gets close.  That interacts poorly with the due date resets and means that the course isn't really self-paced.   I also received a non-passing grade on a module three hours before the due date closed it off when I had submitted it a month before.",4
2907,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,John M,"Feb 11, 2023","Course covers the right material, but does not cover it well (much is left uncovered or just with cursory mention).

2908,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Miguel D B,"Sep 2, 2022","I think this course provides a fair balance of videos, readings and exercises. The course provides 2 free books (one is basic and the other requires more math), which the reader can follow along with the videos.

2910,Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning by University of Colorado Boulder,Zehu C,"Apr 4, 2022",the course is comprehensive and rigorous and provides good exercise with the assignment.

I found that the programming assessments use some unusual approaches in them to reflect the overall concepts in the videos.
This course needs a better balance between concept and code.
I can easily set up a test scenario using sklearn by pulling in a set of data and splitting it into a test and training set, then fit it to assess the performance of the Model using those test and train sets, but there is no time spent on showing how to do that properly in python in this Introductory course.
More practical real world useful python examples need to be covered in the videos otherwise the student is left to scouring the internet for the information they need. Many times I find that to be large waste of my time and find little to no good (or wrong) examples of how to use python for machine learning.

For those who are new machine learning, it is too brief and lacks explaination of practical aspects. I don't understand how someone with no ML experience is expected to do these buggy programming assigments with almost no guidance and little lecture materials explaining working with ML libraries.

2947,Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance by New York University,B S C,"Aug 22, 2018","Excellent course with some tech glitches that are being cleared up.
1) Outstanding lecturer in terms of both ML and Finance
2) Real substance to the course - e.g. I do ML in finance and have for some time, yet I found this ""guided tour"" to offer some real opportunities for thinking and working.
3) I think that compared to ML classes that use toy problems to illustrate ML algorithms, Prof Halperin sets up the problems so that students have to  figure things out.  This is an uncommon practice, and I welcome it, but not everybody will.
For example,there was an assignment involving censored regression that required students to actually do some research - like, searching google or Wikipedia to figure out the special characteristics of the regression problem being posed, and relate it back to the code.  The kind of thing one might expect in a college course.  This stands in contrast to spoon-fed projects and assignment that are common in MOOCs.    This is unfortunately mistaken by many students for an accident (it did not help that there were some technical glitches with grading early on).  It's still easy in terms of poblem-solving in contrast to many Quant MBA -tyype courses.
So, for people who want to get a Certificate that they know ML for Finance without doing much to earn it, this class may not be what they're looking for.   Those who want to learn a bit, and do so  under conditions intended to offer some features of real-world applications, will be rewarded.",5

(3) Some people complained about professor's accent, he does have a fairly prominent Russian accent, but everything is still very much understandable and you can't hold something like this against him. (4) Some people claim that although they ""have a strong math background"" the material in lectures is intentionally made sound hard. I have a math background too and found his explanations very intuitive. My undergraduate math treatment of related topics was much more rigorous that this. (5) Others complain about there being too much math/many equations in lectures. ML is about math, if this tiny bit of mathematical rigor is too much for you, you should not be doing ML. (6) To my surprise, some people are wondering who are the target audience. The professor clearly states that the audience for the class is people with ML background willing to learn some financial applications. This is not really to teach you ML from scratch, but to introduce ML professionals to the field of finance.

3015,Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance by New York University,Russell H,"Sep 1, 2018","Good overview of ML in Finance, clearly based on real-world experience.  Would not recommend this as a first ML course; probably more useful after first taking another more general course, such as Guestrin's UW ML specialization.  Some of the quizzes and exercises seem a bit rushed; e.g., out of order vs. the lectures and not clear about what is required.  It was sometimes necessary to consult the discussion forums for clarification.  The most useful part may be the categorization of ML algorithms along different axes, including applicability to different areas of finance.  The readings and coding exercises seem to come mostly from Geron's O'Reilly book, so plan on buying that (it's a great book, so you should buy it whether you take this course or not).",4

This is not to say that it's perfect, in fact as others say the assignments are quite challenging because there's little introduction to the problem/solution being asked. But that's exactly where the fun is! You need to search for the information yourself to solve the problem, much like in the real world. In fact I took another course on TensorFlow in the middle of this course to finish the assignment. But I can imagine this would be frustrating for those with less background on ML or programming, or people who expect everything to be presented smoothly for them.",4

As such, the lecture videos are succinct and informative. (I will issue the caveat that in order to make the most of this course, one should be already be comfortable with linear algebra, statistics, some calculus and the python libraries mentioned in the prerequisites.) The readings are mostly relevant, at times tangential and in some cases completely off-topic (albeit still somewhat interesting). What perhaps makes this course frustrating, as some have already noted, is that some of the code is outdated. The course, having been taught several years ago, uses version 1 of Tensorflow, and so backtesting assignment code on your own Jupyter notebook can be tricky if you have the latest version installed. It's for this reason that I give this course only 3/5. I got a lot out of it, but it would have helped if it used the latest version of Tensorflow.",3
3057,Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance by New York University,Roland E,"Jan 9, 2020","The assignments and project are very briefly explained. It took me a lot of unnecessary time to figure out what I was supposed to do. Also the discussion forum is inactive and I have a feeling many leave after seeing not anyone respond to their questions. I think there should be one or two dedicated support answering questions at least within 3 days. 
The level of the course in general is pretty high, definitely not beginners level, which is fine I guess, but I do find the lectures are at times going very quick and at times overcomplicate. I would prefer an example to start simple and from there to build for a more complex situation. (For example start the bank failure with say 3 main features and show how you can decide to add another one by showing its impact through deviance and multicollinearity and show how you can then decide to add this new feature or not.)",3

3068,Machine Learning: Classification by University of Washington,Lewis C L,"Jun 13, 2019","First, coursera is a ghost town.  There is no activity on the forum.  Real responses stopped a year ago. Most of the activity is from 3 years ago. This course is dead.
Two, this course seems to approach the topic as teaching inadequate ways to perform various tasks to show the inadequacies. You can learn from that; we will make mistakes or use approaches that are less than ideal.  But, that should be a quick ""don't do this,"" while moving on to better approaches
Three, the professors seem to dismiss batch learning as a ""dodgy"" technique.  If Hinton, Bengio, and other intellectual leaders of the field recommend it as the preferred technique, then it probably is.
Four, the professors emphasize log likelihood. Mathematically, minus the log likelihood is the same as cross-entropy cost. The latter is more robust and applicable to nearly every classification problem (except decision trees), and so is a more versatile formulation. As neither actually plays any roll in the training algorithm except as guidance for the gradient and epsilon formulas and as a diagnostic, the more versatile and robust approach should be preferred.
The professors seem very focused on decision trees.  Despite the ""apparent"" intuitive appeal and computational tractability, the technique seems to be eclipsed by other methods.  Worth teaching and occasionally using to be sure, but not for 3/4 of the course.
There are many mechanical problems that remain in the material.  At least 6 errors in formulas or instructions remain.  Most can be searched for on the forum to find some resolution, through a lot of noise. Since the last corrections were made 3 years ago, the UW or Coursera's lack of interest shows.
It was a bit unnecessary to use a huge dataset that resulted in a training matrix or over 10 billion cells.  Sure, if you wanted to focus on methods for scaling--very valuable indeed--go for it.  But, this lead to unnecessary long training times and data issues that were, at best, orthogonal to the overall purpose of highlighting classification techniques and encouraging good insights about how classification techniques work.
The best thing about the course was the willingness to allow various technologies to be used.  The developers went to some lengths to make this possible.  It was far more work to stray outside the velvet ropes of the Jupiter notebooks, but it was very rewarding.
Finally, the quizzes were dependent on numerical point answers that could often be matched only by using the same exact technology and somewhat sloppy approaches (no lowercase for word sentiment analysis, etc.).  It does take some cleverness to think of questions that lead to the right answer if the concepts are implemented properly.  It doesn't count when the answers rely precisely on anomalies.
I learned a lot, but only because I wrote my own code and was able to think more clearly about it, but that was somewhat of a side effect.
All in all, a disappointing somewhat out of date class.",2

Also, SVM was not discussed, but there were many other topics which all other courses and books easily skips. The programming assignments were fine, more focused on teaching the algorithms than trapping someone in the coding part. This series is the series for someone who really wants to get a hold of what machine learning really is.

Some may regret the absence of a few ""classic"" algorithms like SVM but Carlos definitely made his point about it in the forum and did not exclude the addition of an optional module about it.

This course is no exception and exposed me to a lot of new concepts and helped me to improve my python programming skills. I am left wondering if the programming assignments were made easier over time given all of the hints and ""checkpoints"" for code that was already supplied. I understand this is not a programming course but I probably would have been okay with toiling away at the algorithms for a few more hours without the hints. But that's just me. Great course. ",5
3088,Machine Learning: Classification by University of Washington,Ferenc F P,"Jan 18, 2018","This is a very good course in classification. Starts with logistic regression (w. and wo. regularization) and then makes a very good introduction to decision trees and boosting. Also has a very good explanation about stochastic gradient descent. The only drawback is that for some Quizes the result is different with scikit-learn than with Graphlab while the Quiz is prepared for Graphlab results. Thus, with scikit-learn one may fail some of them.  ",5
3089,Machine Learning: Classification by University of Washington,Samuel d Z,"Jul 11, 2017","AWESOME!!! Very well structured. Concepts are explained in small and short videos which focus on one thing at the time. Unnecessary clutter is removed and deep dives can now be done with this solid foundation.

The challenges will be in the same order as the previous challenges, so don't expect any synthesis of skills you have developed.

The first was the Resources limits on AWS regarding the instance type which I needed AWS support to engage on.  This created some lag time to finishing the material.  The way the course is designed now it assumes that you work through it in one session.  Coming back to it creates some issues (such as the model needed to be retrained to be served).

It's called Exploratory Data Analysis, but is actually all about the graphics systems in R. And it does a botched job on those as well.
All quizzes and assignments are about the graphics systems. The only portion of the course that deviates from that is Week 3 (for which there is no quiz or project) where we ""learn"" about clustering and dimension reduction. However, that material is presented really poorly: not enough depth for someone who is already familiar with the subject matter; and not nearly well enough explained for newbies.
On the graphics side, none of the systems is explored in great depth. The lattice system is essentially just mentioned in passing. 
To cap it all off, the brief for the last assignment is really ambiguous, which often causes  perfectly valid work to be graded poorly by peers. (Just look at the forums, if you need proof.)",2

3321,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Johann R,"May 28, 2017","Graphs and plotting is at the heart of data analysis and data science, and without it you would have difficulty conveying ideas, and having graphs to explain numerical/statistical data is always handy. Visual representation of a data set, and using visual cues to gain an understanding of data, can save a lot of time, and can help you gain additional insights into the data. This course teaches you key techniques on how to apply some graphing and plotting methods to visually explore data, and it does so really well and in great detail, and also provides some good demos. ",5
3322,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Anthony C C,"Sep 28, 2017",I was able to learn the material presented over the time of the course. It's a lot of material to cover in the time I could commit to it but I feel confident using the tools and methods presented. The projects were very valuable both from getting to practice the methods and tooling and also from seeing how other students approached the solutions. I really helped put all the options into context and highlighted the value of using the different tools and where to use them. Only knock would be sometimes the background noises in the videos were distracting.,5
3323,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Tarun S,"Apr 29, 2017","I really appreciate the course design. Even if somebody doesn't have
much background in R, she/he can comfortably learn from the videos and
understand the concepts. The exercises and project assignments are challenging
and actually help you practice and re-visit the lectures and explore further.
Though I had already known and used Clustering, PCA and SVD in my work before,
I really liked the way these concepts were explained here. I would strongly
recommend this course to anybody who is keen to see R in action!",5
3324,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Amanuel G,"Jan 6, 2017",It was a wonderful experience to read the structure of data before delving into the  advanced statistical levels of data analysis.The need for inclusion or exclusion of dependent variables or dimension reduction in regression analysis can  be  intuitively understood and visualized using Data Exploratory techniques and then we have the clue as what to do in the next level.It is like putting the whole characteristic of the data under full control.,5
3325,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Monisha D,"Apr 23, 2020","I strongly recommend this course to anyone who needs clearer understanding of data using Visualizations.  The course is well structured and each lecture delivers new concepts in concise format with a very detailed swirl lessons to understand the working of each functions.  At the end of the course, I got a completely different view of handling the data and how to extract maximum information from the data to gain meaningful insights. ",5
3326,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Tejus M,"May 25, 2018","This course is the first real step from using R for basic data manipulation/stats, to using it for advanced stats. However, the videos on PCA (principal component analysis) and SVD (singular value decomposition) were difficult to understand, and I had to view several videos on YouTube (e.g., StateQuest or Standord U) that do a far better job of explaining. Once I did that, the course videos seemed to make more sense.",5

This course coupled with Applied Charting with Python will complete my skillset. Looking forward to the rest of the specialization. ,5
3329,Exploratory Data Analysis by Johns Hopkins University,Marcelo S,"Dec 11, 2017","Great Course. Week 3 requires a bit of mathematical savvy (google SVD/PCA), but since there is no quiz, it won't affect your ability to finish the course, just your ability to fully understand what you are doing. The last project was a bit challenging, which is always good, but most of the information to complete it and earn full marks is in the discussion forums as usual. ",5

Half way into the specialization the creators sold Turi, GrapLab's parent company, making it non available to the general public (not even by paying) and then all the knowledge devalued. I wish I had known this and I would have enrolled on a different specialization. The creators still give you the possibility of using numpy, scikit learn and pandas but I had already done a lot with GraphLab create. The time I invested on my nights after work became a waste. I was trying to convince the company I worked for to buy licenses for GraphLab create. 
Coursera should not allow folks to create courses that promote a private license course because it would make people waste their time and money if they decide to privatize the software.  
Don't take this course, and if you take it then only use GraphLab create when the authors give you no other option.

Installation in the beginning took some time and research. Many of the assignments have errors and bugs in the code that have not been updated.  Forum assistance is abysmal for clarification or deeper questions.  Many links are dead.
There are many times in the lectures where the instructors are writing several sentences in their handwriting on their notes instead of having the text ready to appear.

For some Quiz the result is different with scikit-learn than with Graphlab while the Quiz is prepared for Graphlab results. What is really helping is the notebooks provided to each programming assignment, so basically one need to write only a few lines of code when using Graphlab in order to pass the Quiz.

This course is part math, part algorithms and part application (in Python). I loved it. The instructors are good and the material is generally well presented (I took the course the first time through, so there seemed to be a few gaps / rough edges.)
This course may be intimidating if you don't like mathematical notation, or if you have never used Python before. It may also be challenging if your high school / college freshman calculus is rusty. The concepts aren't super hard (basic statistics, integration, differentiation, matrix math but with multi-variate twists), but you will need to think carefully through some lessons to appreciate them.
The online tests are good - and the instructions for each week's problems are detailed. There is enough guidance to clearly show what needs to be done, but enough gaps to bridge that you're made to think about the problem at hand.",5

3449,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Theo L,"Jan 6, 2016","This course was well structured and well executed.  I thoroughly enjoyed and was challenged by the material in the course.  I appreciated the assignment/quiz approach to deal with such dense topics.  I can see where people who have backgrounds in a number of the topics discussed throughout the course could feel there was too much hand holding, but I found the level of hints/help in the assignments were at the right level for me to work through & gain deeper understanding for the material presented.
My one criticism of the course stems from the denseness of the material.  I believe there is an opportunity to introduce more quizzes after various sections within each module.  It would be best to make these quizzes optional in order not to turn off more advance students, but I believe it would be beneficial for those students who do not have much, or any, experience in these topics to have more opportunities to test and gain deeper understanding in the material just covered.
Overall, solid course!",5

The assignments are amazingly well designed. I get to practice the theory I learn from the lectures which truly reinforces what we review.
Even though I don't use the alternative tools (like Pandas), I appreciate that the organizers of the class prepare files and data sets for people who use those tools.
Another thing that's really valuable to me its' the fact that assignments (data, instructions, Jupyter, etc.) can be worked on completely offline and only need Internet connectivity to post results. Because all we do is enter numbers and select a few options, I have successfully submitted my assignments 10 minutes away from boarding a plane. I have had the chance work while riding a car (not driving it, LOL) or in an airplane. Because I have a full-time job, this is a HUGE advantage.",5
3451,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Havan A,"Mar 13, 2016","This is an amazing and brilliant course for machine learning. If you've done Andrew Ng's course, most of this material will feel familiar, but definitely has a lot more detail. Each sub-topic under regression is taken with a decent level of detail, with sufficient quiz and assignment questions to drill important concepts into your head. The lectures are lucid and concise, even the optional ones that cover more advanced concepts of the underlying math.
As an aside, I would like to clarify to any reader that, when they say you can use other tools, they aren't being a 100% honest. After a few assignments of using Scala and R, I quickly realized that using their iPython notebooks is the simplest and most straightforward way of clearing this course. Eventually, the assignments are such that using any other tool can cause a lot of strife.
Brilliant course. Looking forward to the next one.",5

Some of the other reviews complain about the use of graphlab but really it has no impact on the value of the course, because you can literally write the functions from scratch yourself using standard python and Numpy. The use of graphlab is just to speed things up in some of the programming assignments. One or 2 of the quizzes had some incorrect values in the notebooks but a quick search of the forums showed the correct ones and the ability to reattempt the quizzes means it's not a big issue. Emily is an excellent lecturer and the constant use of graphical aids and annotations makes it very easy to follow even with some of the fairly advanced maths.",5

I took Ng's original ML coursera course, and it was good, but this one was much more involved and helped me better understand essential concepts in machine learning and data science. I feel confident that I can apply the skills I have learned in this course to future applications. While the lecturer sometimes repeated herself, she did well to explain some of the more difficult concepts. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a better grasp of statistics and regression analysis. The only thing I found lacking was that there was no exploration of forecasting, extrapolation, or otherwise making predictions beyond the boundaries of the training data. I feel like this is an important skill, and believe it could have been included among what was covered here.",5

I would have liked to see SVR and ensemble methods as part of this class but I understand they will be covered in another course. I used graphlab for all of the assignments but I also used numpy and and pandas when I couldn't find the functions I was looking for in graphlab. I was not a fan of the coursera hosted notebooks with graphlab for the first course but running it off my own machine was a different experience and I could definitely be sold on a single solution in place of numpy, pandas, and scikit learn.

It will be interesting to see if the subsequent courses in the specialisation continue in this vein - I hope so. I note the concerns that some have expressed about the use of  graphlab.create for examples and assignments, but tend to think there is benefit from gaining familiarity with a number of different data science ML tools and libraries. Also additional code and instructions are available for those determined to use other tools such as Pandas and Scikit Learn. ",5

I only wish there was not such an emphasis on Graphlab. Although they do allow you to use other methods to finish the assignments, it feels as though more attention is given to explaining how Graphlab works instead of standard, free python libraries. I understand that they're trying to push a product, but I don't want to pay for something I'll only be using for a few courses. More attention should be given to sklearn. ",5

However, considering how complex these concepts are, the material was very clearly conveyed overall; and the assignments were very helpful. There seem to be a number of these types of specializations available on Coursera; and they all seem really good. However, I started out with the University of Washington machine learning specialization and haven't looked back. Well done!",5
3476,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Vaidas A,"Feb 7, 2016","This course is great! I had a lot of fun going through the exercises and concepts they show are really relevant. I am not sure about the level of the whole series, as it probably is more towards beginner than intermediate, but it's great to get some practice with Python and learn / brush-up / deepen knowledge in ML. 
I am really looking forward to the next class - that's probably the area I would like this series to improve, the gaps between courses  are just too long.
Overall great work!
Thanks!",5
3477,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Keng-Hui W,"Aug 19, 2016","I'll definitely keep learning the next course.
Some people criticized about graphlab (I thought they should offer 2 versions like RStudio instead a limit-free one. Although I feel comfortable when using graphlab, I'll still use scikit-learn after finishing all courses because it is free and I just use for personally.) but you can use scikit-learn to pass this course (although you have to spend more time) , so this is not a sufficient reason to not giving 5 stars for me.
Great course.",5
3478,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,michal b,"Jan 1, 2016","I took and finished Andrew Ng ML course before and I though I 'now i know something about ML', after finishing this course I feel less confident and I can see how many things there are ahead to learn. Especially when it comes to relation between size of sets vs features / model / tuning parameters of model. How much different prediction you can get with the same data!
I can't wait to next part because after Andres Ng's course I started mini project using classification.",5
3479,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Uday A,"Apr 3, 2017","Amazing course - the material is taught at a good pace, and with sufficient depth. The assignments are a little confusing though - between pandas and Graphlab, it gets tough to figure out what to take as reference (the iPython notebook uses Graphlab whereas the course page uses pandas/sci-kit). There are differences in language and input values for the two, and it wasn't mentioned anywhere so it took time getting used to. All in all, great course! Thanks :)",5
3480,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Christopher A,"Dec 18, 2015","Excellent. My favourite machine learning course since Andrew Ng's class. Thorough treatment. Took us from easier hand-holding to deep in the implementation details. Talked both about theoretical considerations as well as practical fine tuning. Would maybe liked to have seen a bit more talked about the problems with data that can affect model fit (multicollinearity / skew / etc) but time constraints don't allow it in an already excellently ""meaty"" course.",5
3481,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Jane z,"Jan 15, 2020","Truly enjoyed this course!  The hands-on approach is the best for deepening the understanding of the concepts and applying theories to real problems.
The 'check points', such as 'should print 0.0237082324496' ,in the jupyter notebooks are extremely valuable when other type of help is hard to obtain.
I would take classes like this in the future.  Maybe, I will do a search on line to see what turn up as the closest neighbors of this course :)
THANK YOU!!!",5
3482,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Ayman K,"Jan 19, 2017","I've studied regression and other ML concepts in so many ways, but never have I been able to understand the concepts as I did after auditing this course. I learned the following the hard way: If you want to really get an intuitive, theoretical & practical understanding of ML, you have to listen to a statistician! If I were to realize this fact earlier, I would've never jumped into ML without a degree in statistics. I do highly recommend this course.",5
3483,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Tsz W K,"Apr 26, 2017","It's a truely amazing course. Having studied so much econometrics from undergraduate to PhD, I still learnt so much from this regression course. This course teaches me regressions in a way that is very different from any economics/business schools I have ever attended. While it is technically less demanding than most econometric courses from second year (UG) onwards, it is the applied/practical nature of this course that makes it so valuable.",5
3484,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Daniel C,"Mar 16, 2016","Amazing - way more depth than the first course, and much narrower focus.  Emily teaches all courses here and dives into the math and usage.  Programming hints are given but no more walkthroughs of the code.  Assignments laid out such that you need to code the algorithms correctly in order to pass assignments.  Emily has an excellent way of explaining the math/calculous/reasoning behind the algorithms and proofs thereof.  Love it.",5
3485,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Jaiyam S,"Jan 1, 2016",This is one of the best online courses out there and not just about Machine Learning. The course was very well organized and the teaching staff was very helpful in resolving whatever issues cropped up. I would suggest you to provide additional readings/ references at the end of the course in 'Closing remarks'. Thank you Profs. Emily and Carlos for the wonderful course. Keep up the good work! I am looking forward to the next one. ,5
3486,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Juan C A,"Jan 10, 2016",This is an excellent course! Emily Fox does an excellent job at explaining what could be a hard concept grasp. I am talking about convex optimization and the LASSO solution. I have taken graduate level classes in convex optimization and the math is high level and can be challenging. The animation Emily presents along with the geometric intuitive explanation drives the intuition home. Thank you Emily and Carlos for this class.,5
3487,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Kevin K,"Oct 31, 2016","Applications and examples are well-chosen. The choice of theory is appropriate given the audience. The problem sets are a tad on the difficult side in that extreme care must be taken to get the right answers. Some of this has to do with how the assignments are structure. Instructions need to be read several times, which can be quite tedious. In the end, they help you learn the material and force you to implement carefully.  ",5
3488,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Samuel d Z,"Jun 27, 2017","Awesome. You need a little bit of experience but things are explained really well. So glad I took this course, I tried another one from another university, it was disastrous. It certainly helps when you know how to do programming as this takes a lot of time and can be frustrating if you are new at it. Still worth learning it this way. Would recommend to use the GraphLab and maybe later redo it with standard Python tools.",5
3489,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Tanmay G,"Feb 21, 2016","Fantastic course in regression, taught with the mathematical rigor necessary to really understand (not just use) the concepts. The instructors both do an amazing job introducing the concepts piece by piece in a logical and easy to follow manner.

3491,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Pawan K S,"Feb 14, 2016","This course is very detailed and have lot of information about regression, should be taken by anyone who wants to become master in it. But each lesson should be given a week, otherwise it becomes over whelming.  Assignments are good as well, though some of them should have better instruction.
There should have been a programming assignment on kernal regression as well, as it is one of the upcoming technique.",5
3492,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Stephane F,"Dec 31, 2015","Professor Fox is explaining the main algorithms (gradient / coordinate descent)  in a clear and understandable way. Quite often, in blogs and reviews, Andrew Ng's course (at Stanford) is mentioned as the reference, to me it looks like these series of courses can match Ng's course on machine learning (using Octave). Being based on Python I would give the advantage to this course and recommend it.",5
3493,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Olexandra Z,"Feb 5, 2017","Really great explanations for complex and important principles as well as math approaches and tools. Being a mathematician, I thought that in this math aspect there would be nothing new for me, but still it was a great refreshment and very useful explanations to understand how those methods actually work for machine learning tasks. Great balance of theory and practical applications! Thank you!",5
3494,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Gabor S,"Jan 17, 2017",This a well thought out course. From the simple concepts it gradually takes you to the more complex ones. The quizzes and programming assignments help you to really understand the problems that were introduced in the videos.  The video slides of every module can be downloaded as a pdf document which makes the material easily searchable. And last but not least Emily Fox is a great instructor. ,5
3495,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Leon W,"Jun 17, 2016",I learned quite a lot during this which I can use in practice. Everything is well explained in the video's. If I had to call a down side then I would say that I had a hard time with the math. This is because I never did something matrices and linear algebra. For those people who miss this background info I would like to say: if you're dedicated then you should be able to survive this course!,5
3496,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Stefan K,"Dec 30, 2015","Very good course with detailed explanations, both great lecturers, lets you choose environment of your liking for the assignments(python and graphlab are preferred).

If you contribute lot of time and effort, you will learn a lot.",5
3497,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Asim I,"Dec 20, 2015","Awesome. Pure awesome. Great presentation on the theory and all the assignments force you to code solutions from scratch, you're not dependent on Graphlab. Very detailed presentation of advanced topics not covered in other superficial introductions to regression. And practical advice from the instructors shows that they are imparting practical real-world advice on running regression.",5
3498,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,David H,"May 31, 2016","Congrats to Carlos and Emily on producing a great course. As a humble software developer with no statistics background (and someone who hasn't used calculus since they left school nearly 30 years ago) I found this course to be very accessible, the concepts clearly explained, and the results of the course work have been rewarding. Thanks for kick-starting my little grey cells again. ",5
3499,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Philippe N,"Apr 17, 2020","I found this course really well presented and structured. II am currently developing myself a course on models and data and I have found many good ways of teaching in the presented content. The course could be even better if mentors were more responsive on the forum, as it is the case for most Coursera courses. I would encourage Coursera to take extra care of this kind of issues. ",5
3500,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,William C,"Jan 3, 2021",I really enjoyed this course on regression. The teaching was second to none and the course material was excellent. The assignments were relatively challenging but the slides and videos did a great job of boiling down difficult ideas into intuitive steps; they really helped! I will recommend this course to friends and colleagues interested in learning about regression and ML,5
3501,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Jens K,"May 29, 2018","Great course that guides you to coding regression (linear, polynomial and ridge regression with gradient descend, lasso with coordinate descend, and linear-average kNN), as well as demonstrating key statistical concepts in the slides and while doing the exercises.

The assignments are challenging enough to be worth the effort.  Great specialization... I look forward to completing every class.",5
3506,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Christopher M,"Jan 27, 2019","Great course.  You get to write the algorithms for OLS regressions, ridge regression, lasso regression, and for k-nearest neighbor models.  The instruction even includes some optional graduate-level videos on with more detailed explanations of how more advanced algorithms for solving the regressions may be developed (eg, subgradients for lasso regression).",5

3508,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Mohamed A H,"Nov 28, 2018","This course is extremely awesome! 
The instructors are really professional and straight to the point. The topics are explained clearly and the assignments are crucially useful because you get to implement the concepts and algorithms in hand. Actually, you can't find a thing that's not nice about this course, at least I couldn't ;)
Very recommended!",5

3513,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Phil O,"Dec 10, 2018","4.9 Stars really but had to round. Really enjoyable course and extremely well presented. As a working statistician/analyst this stuff hits on a lot of the import underlying logic that needs to be in your head when looking at real world projects. The 0.1 star drop is because some of the language in the questions can be confusing, an easy fix. ",5
3514,Machine Learning: Regression by University of Washington,Ridhwanul H,"Oct 16, 2017","Was also a great course, but personally found myself a bit confused at the last two module - lasso regression and kernel regression.

3558,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Baurjan S,"Jan 27, 2020",There were so many errors through the course and so much confusion. I don't think the instructor made the expected amount of effort to polish his code and fix numerous bugs that I had to fix to make this work. Overall it's a useful course to start with model deployment on Azure but the instructor is bored and is boring. Keep that in mind.  ,3
3559,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Turkesh P,"Jun 3, 2020",the content is not well organised and the instructor is just reading out the ppt on screen,1
3560,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Andreas F K,"May 3, 2020","Overall the course content is OK and you can get a grip on some concepts. But the form of presentation was seriously lacking in quality. The presenter is not a qualified speaker, but what was insanely annoying, was the magnifying glass cursor, which made it impossible to read what he was actually highlighting! The permanent fiddling with the recording isn't very professional either.",3
3561,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Daniel F,"Apr 24, 2020",The teacher talks slow and mostly only reads the presentation slides. Slides and tests have many errors and mistypes.,2
3562,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Md R I,"Apr 26, 2020","A lot of ""click on this and click on that"", and none of ""why you should click on this rather than that"". Makes you wonder if the instructor himself understands the topic or just reading from a script like a parrot. When he is not (apparently mindlessly) clicking on stuff, he is reading from presentation slides WORD FOR WORD, which further supports the parrot theory. Even those readings include numerous errors and mispronunciations. You are much better off just reading the documentation for respective services.",1
3563,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Willie A,"May 30, 2020",Content is good but I would rather the presenter not read off slides. Poor recording of the video with varying degrees of loudness which made it uncomfortable to watch. ,1

3565,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Singhi K,"Mar 10, 2020","Good coverage of basic features, but delivery from the intructor is somewhat wooden without any emotives. Also the course focuses on just running through the steps which make it less useful - as one can always go through documentations. The fundamentals or design philosophy of the cloud services which azure provides, compare contrast with how one would normally do the same tasks without cloud would make it more interesting and conceptual course. But for me it still provided me with good overview of azure quickly which was helpful. So I can't rate the course harshly as well.",5
3566,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Usman A,"Mar 25, 2020",The explanation is very poor.,3
3567,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Jeffrey W B,"Aug 17, 2020","Painfully boring.  I quit in the middle of Week 2.  Video lectures consist solely of the professor reading slides in a monotone.  Text associated with each video is usually a wall of text, one loooooong paragraph with no whitespace to give the reader a break.  The worst problem with this course: minimal hands-on work.  The *focus* of this course should be hands-on work; we can learn the theory through it.",1
3568,Developing AI Applications on Azure by LearnQuest,Christophe C,"Jun 12, 2020","Not well structured, not well explained, just someone telling what he is doing and not why, videos were edited to fix issues but not everywhere, difficult to follow examples because one video says something wrong but somehow in the next video it has been fixed. Wouldn't recommend that course.",1

The course is designed for ML developers who want to learn how to program scripts to set up models in Python and run them on the Azure cloud. My expectation was to see more low code applications in Azure as I have already done ML courses in python. 
Besides that, the voice and the presentation of the teacher are not really motivating and make the learning experience absolutely inefficient. To be honest: it was a pain to complete this course. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1

Amazing how he subtly puts a joke or two in middle of explaining something. I feel the course could benefit from a little more programming content / assignments, and some more math behind the ideas presented.

3700,Introduction to Recommender Systems: Non-Personalized and Content-Based by University of Minnesota,CH L,"Apr 6, 2020","The pace is too slow. Lectures spend lots of time on examples, and all kinds of possible variables.
These make stories very long, and badly-structured. It may be better to introduce only one concept at any moment, and discuss the problem and the solution immediately after mentioning the concept. That will help students to focus on the point and get it right sooner. It's good to combine all these concepts together after we've known everything, but not at the very beginning.
Also the programming assignment is really bad. As a CS student, I spent almost 90% of time on realizing the architecture, tools and libraries. I don't think these third-party libraries are helpful here. The same tasks can be implemented by pure Java code even more efficiently (for coding). Most non-CS students will find it difficult to use, while CS students can learn only little from the assignment since the core ideas to implement are far too easy.
I can feel how much knowledge lectures expect us to get from this lecture, but it really needs a rebuilding. Maybe trying to put a self limitation on video length will be a good start. Expressing a brief idea in a short video, and allowing students to consume one video even with only a piece of time, should be one of the most appealing part in flip-classroom.",3

Very diluted content.

Easy to follow even when listening only. The course lectures is very detailed, and that is one thing I really liked. The videos does feel a bit long, and maybe we can chop it to smaller sub-topics.
The interviews are very interesting and show a glimpse of broader universe of recommendation system. However, the concepts explained in the interview is a bit hard to follow, as there is no accompanying presentation materials and it jumps to detailed content with little context
The regular exercise feels very easy but helpful to make the concepts concrete. The Honors programming exercise looks interesting & challenging, but it seems too hard for someone with no programming background.

3805,Introduction to Recommender Systems: Non-Personalized and Content-Based by University of Minnesota,Chunyang S,"Feb 3, 2017","Generally I like the contents of this course. I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches. However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep. I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills. 
Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts. I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise. Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems. Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction. For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?! Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications. Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task. It really makes the assignment experience awful.",3

3859,Web of Data by EIT Digital,Geoff S,"Jun 9, 2022","While I enjoyed the course and learned some new things from it, there were several things that stopped me from giving it a higher rating.

1) Several of the quizzes relied on web applications that were broken. They returned server errors whenever I tried to use them. I was able to work around this problem by finding an alternative site with a similar application, or in one case calculating the required query by hand. I did report the issues using the ""Report Issue"" link on the page, but have seen no response at all. 

2) I felt that the depth of exploration of the subjects was very shallow and superficial. Semantic triples are a fascinating topic with a lot of potential, and had hoped to get a little more from the course than I did.


3) There was no real hands on experimentation to speak of. In the other Coursera MOOC I had previously done, each week had a series of assignments we had to write code for and submit both the code and the results for peer grading. I felt this allowed the course materal a much greater chance of sinking in. In this MOOC, the quizzes didn't really allow us to play and experiment to see if we could figure out how to solve problems ourselves.

I was particularly keen on learning more about semantic triples as I use them in my day job, but just felt this course could have been a lot more effective in teaching about them.",3

Much of the course had confusing terminology/grammatical forms which made multiple lessons difficult to understand. The video quality was, for the most part, very well done -- but some videos moved too quickly to follow (although it may just be my current level is too low).
I really enjoyed the case studies for the most part; they were challenging and informative, forcing you to learn yourself. There were a couple of areas where I would've appreciated more guidance, such as setting up the MLP/CNN at the end of Week 2. I had no idea that we needed to use a sparse-categorical-crossentropy loss function until I looked at the solution -- and I'm not sure other students would know the same.
Otherwise, it was a useful course.",2

4046,Reinforcement Learning in Finance by New York University,Yi B,"Apr 15, 2019","I leave this review after I have completed the specialization of all 4 courses.
The first two courses of the specialization are somewhat useful in understanding some concepts, even though they are apparently not good enough and often full of bizarre design. 
Now here comes the third one, with much worse experience. The teaching quality is as mediocre as the first two. The instructor has been overly obsessed in his physics analogy without being aware what he actually needs to teach. The content is unnecessarily theoretical and makes one lost. I appreciate that this is intellectually interesting, maybe to some people. Nevertheless, it does not meet my expectation at all. The assignment of this course is open-ended and continue to be irrelevant from what the videos are.
Conclusion: The course is not mature enough. If someone wants to learn machine learning in finance with efficiency and practicality, he or she should consider other options instead of this specialization/course.",1

It provides practical financial applications of RL, albeit with a significant mathematical demand, which makes it challenging for those who need a strong base in the necessary prerequisites.

4081,Moneyball and Beyond by University of Michigan,Kevin . H,"Oct 27, 2022","I could not have been more disappointed in this course. Its lack of depth, both mathematically and from a sports analysis perspective, shocked me. This course spends almost no time at all on WHY any of the statistics presented are used. Nor on how to develop models to evaluate sport performance. Rather, it focuses almost entirely on prescriptive steps on how to calculate basic stats models. And, given all the time that is spent just walking through the code, one might expect that it is instructive and well-written. Sadly, that is not the case. The code for the course DRAMATICALLY under uses the power of the libraries included (Pandas and Numpy). Effectively, the first 4 weeks of the course are just tediously walking through dozens of convoluted lines of code, to do something that could have been 2 lines by simply using Pandas built-in functions.
So, if you are interested in learning about statistical analysis methods for sports, you can literally watch the first video from week 5 and get 95% of the value of this course without having to slog through 4 weeks of (badly) coding up basically 2 regressions, only to prove that when two different people do the same math, they will arrive at the same result.
If you are interested in learning how to use Python to do sports analysis, AVOID THIS CLASS COMPLETELY!! The lectures contain no information about how to apply any of what’s covered to anything outside of the one example given. AND, the code is so needlessly convoluted, it’s clear that whomever wrote it did NOT know how to use the tools available to them. So, if you are newer to Python, this course would be a little like trying to learn how to cook in an Italian style, by listening to someone read a recipe for canned spaghetti.",1

Lastly, the recording quality of some of the lectures is awful, it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for Coursera.

I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications. 
The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.
Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.",5
4121,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Antonio F,"Jan 4, 2017","This course has changed my way to look at everyday's work. Not only with respect to the explaination to others of your work, why you take an approach compared to another, what is the sequence of your data cleaning and processing etc. It is especially useful to avoid the pain of re-learning by ourselves what we learned 6 months, one year, two years ago. Great course, one of the best of the specialization.",5
4122,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Kalle H,"Dec 7, 2017","Very good. Could go deeper in some areas but gives  a good introduction to Rmarkdown, knitr, and general information about how to make research reproducible and why this is important. The course is of not only of great value for academic students but also of value to people working in a commercial industry. The coursework was good and I learned a lot from looking at how others tackled the same problem. ",5
4123,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,João F,"Dec 25, 2017","Great course on how to document and report an analysis, from getting access to raw data up to the presentation of the findings. knitr and R Markdown are very good tools for reporting. As working with data becomes more complex it's of the utmost importance that Data Analytics Professionals present their work in a reproducible manner. Dr. Peng is an excellent professor and online instructor. Thanks!",5
4124,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,David N,"Nov 22, 2016","Reproducibility of results is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Full reproduction is not always practical, but in 2016 it should almost always be possible to present the computations behind research so that others may retrace and validate the steps taken.  Professor Peng is a thought leader in this idea and provides a well-designed introductory course in ""Reproducible Research"".",5
4125,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Sk M,"Jun 30, 2017","My experience of taking this course was really challenging and great, today  I got to know how it is critical and crucial to Reproduce exact result as per author original research. I also got to understand that after having all analysis, but if your codes are not reproducible then your work has no good value. Reproducible Research is one of the most important part of data science.",5
4126,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Sujata E,"Dec 12, 2017","I found this class very useful. While it may be easy for some to pick this up on their own, I thought Roger's take on it, as well as the other instructors, impressed on the critical nature of Reproducible research. I found the lessons and the final project valuable in breaking down my own weaknesses in documenting and discovering new aspects of R. I highly recommend this class.",5
4127,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,George G A,"Aug 21, 2017","Loved it! I am not as technical as others in my class, so I struggle a bit with the programming part. However, I understand the importance of and now how to perform Reproducible Research in an industry-wide format. The examples given in the videos, especially regarding medical studies gone awry, stress the importance of attention to detail and reproducibility.",5
4128,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Juan C L T,"Nov 9, 2017","Great course. It provides learner with the knowledge and skills needed to be a modern scientist/analyst, focusing on making analyses reproducible from the beginning to the end. The final project is challenging in terms of proper data cleaning, and it may take much more than 2 hours to complete it adequately. It is of great value to take this course seriously. ",5
4129,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Marco M,"Sep 26, 2020","This is a very interesting course, and I learned much. My skills in markdown improved considerably and I also learned more about RPubs and other platforms. The only thing that could be better are some video lectures, which are too long for a MOOC. Some of them were also recycled from in-person lectures captured on video, which is not ideal.",5
4130,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Keith H,"Jul 19, 2020","I thought this course was great. I think most people do not think about reproducibility of research, how one might achieve it, and why it is so very important. I thought the video on the cancer research was particularly illuminating and showed someone trying to get away with something by hiding as much of their analysis as they could.",5
4131,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,תומר א,"Jul 1, 2020","I think some of the lectures kind of repeat themselves and I got the point quite from the beginning. On the other hand, the case study about Duke really made an impact on me and really made this course worth while. I also really liked the second course project, which really got me understating how to use knitr, rmarkdown and rpubs. ",5
4132,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Kristin A,"Nov 1, 2017","Great focus on learning how to publish and communicate our results! It was a bit of a review for me because I have published in the scientific literature before, but it's a great intro for people who are new to this. I am very happy that this focus on reproducible research and communicating results is part of the curriculum here.",5
4133,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Ailsa D,"Apr 6, 2018","I think this course is very useful and relevant for data scientists and analysts. In order to verify that valid conclusions have been reached, it is vital that analysis can be reproduced. The final project was very interesting and taught me a lot about how I approach analysis projects, and how to improve this going forward.",5
4134,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Robert D,"Nov 14, 2016","In my opinion, this is one of the most valuable courses in the Data Science Specialization.  The principles of tidy data and reproducible research are critical and this course makes an excellent presentation of both.  I have only just completed the course and have already begun using what I learned in my professional life.",5
4135,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Carlos M,"May 1, 2017","Great course with good case studies and clearcut goals - learn knitr, markdown, and a little history of literate programming languages. The importance of making Reproducible Research is ineffable. But, reproducible research won't do anything if the analysis is wrong- this is covered in data pipeline lectures in week 3. ",5
4136,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Sidclay J d S,"Jun 14, 2020","I have learned a lot in this course, for me more important than any tool or technical skill it was the idea of reproducible research, which can be used in many other process. Anyone who has been in a deputy position or replacing someone else at work can easily understand the importance of making things reproducible.",5
4137,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Павел П,"Feb 1, 2016","First I've been thinking that the topic is not so important to create a whole course for it, but after watching it and trying some of the technics mentioned here I found that the quality of my analysis increased , also now I spend much less time trying to organise my scripts, data and findings. Thanks!",5
4138,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Roberto D,"Nov 19, 2016","This was a great course, it proves the value of reproducible research. Case in point, the lecture on where cancer trials were cancelled due to analysis results. This trial withdrawal undoubtedly helped people, either by saving lives or at the vary least not aggravating their condition.",5
4139,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Emmet C,"Sep 7, 2017",Not much fun but very important. This class forced me to learn Git (finally) and to really think about why and how I should make all of my projects reproducible. As usual with this specialization there are a couple of analysis projects thrown in to make sure you're not getting rusty. ,5
4140,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Zhiming,"Sep 25, 2017",I really like this course despite a minor misunderstanding. I did a lot of researches in technical analysis of the financial market and I have not found a solution to document all my researches and findings. Looks like R is the way to go and I will be using the Rmd very frequently. ,5
4141,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Evgeny P,"Feb 23, 2017",I found this course is really important and good. Most valuable takeaway is making you think about other people who will look / challenge or derive your analysis. Looking at work you are doing from this perspective lets you keep things in order and stay as transparent as possible.,5
4142,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Rishabh J,"Aug 28, 2017","The final course project itself was worth taking the entire course. It exposed me to an extremely messy real world data set and what kind of impurities there can be in a data set. Apart from that , the course content was not much and could be completed only in a couple of days.",5
4143,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Chiradip,"Jul 9, 2017",This was such an easy but important course. I think most people would just want to get over with it but it is very important to learn how to reproduce the results. I could totally see why the professors thought to include this in the course although it is not specific to R,5
4144,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Yusuf E,"Feb 2, 2018","This course spanned a single but important topic. The assignments were really important and challenging ( I spent several days on the second one). Overall, a fun course but don't expect anything like R Programming or Getting and Cleaning Data in terms of usefulness.",5
4145,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Молоков М В,"Mar 28, 2017","Данный курс помог мне узнать о новой полезной функции языка R и R studio - создании отчетов с одновременной возможностью анализа данных. Использование данной функции - генерации результатов обработки данных в pdf, word, html файл облегчает работу и анализ данных.",5
4146,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Esteban R F,"Oct 24, 2019","The projects in this course were a real challenge, which demanded to tackle those problems with a mind willing to go to the hedge and discover new horizons. The result was that I ended up the course with real skills for processing data in a reproducible process.",5
4147,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Angela W,"Sep 15, 2017","Despite this being the course with the lamest name (sorry), I really enjoyed it! I learned a lot of new stuff and also got to apply the things that I learned in the previous courses (especially Exploratory Data Analysis), so I feel that this was time well spent.",5
4148,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Deleted A,"Sep 22, 2018","The course was fantastic. I realized the power that a Data Science Analyze can create. In this module in particular, I was even more interested in completing the specialization. Thank you Professor Roger Penn and the entire team of teachers for their teachings.",5
4149,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Arindam M,"Mar 20, 2017",A great course which might not draw the right attention while moving towards a data scientist role. But without a great deal of focus on the communication of analysis is even more important to gain buy-ins within or outside the org. Will keep them in mind.,5
4150,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Scipione S,"Jun 7, 2020","Wonderful course. Maybe you could enlarge the part related on litarate programming, and you could change the position in Data Science Specialization. I also think, it would be better to arrange it after Statistical Inference and Regression Models courses.",5
4151,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Eduardo A,"Feb 11, 2017","This course makes us re-think things that we take for granted. I was shocked in the beginnig on how we ignore practices that should be the basics of any research. As the course progress, I learned new concepts what is essential to our self development.",5
4152,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Arunkumar M R,"Sep 11, 2017",I guess from the case studies and research on the web whats I learned from this course is the importance of reproducible research is.  This course explains the importance of it and the ways to achieve it easily and concisely. Thanks for the authors.,5
4153,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Dan K H,"Apr 12, 2016","This turned out to be one of the more fun courses, especially listening to Rogers lecture ""live in class room"" and also the case presented by M.D. Anderson was great. I really enjoyed this course, even more than I initially expected to.",5
4154,Reproducible Research by Johns Hopkins University,Lowell R,"Oct 7, 2016",This is an excellent course which teaches you fundamental best practices in research.

4311,The R Programming Environment by Johns Hopkins University,Anne N N T A,"Aug 27, 2019","The course dumps a ginormous amount of content onto learners while being extremely poorly structured. The course materials are littered with spelling and formatting errors. There are assignment segments in the course that require R functions that were not covered in the syllabus. Multiple datasets required for stepping through the course materials as well as required assignments were at best not provided by mistake or neglect (datasets.zip file only contains the ""Team Standings"" data), or at worst provided only with the purchase of the textbook + dataset on top of the Coursera subscription fee. Some of these issues could potentially have been solved by having more responsive instructors in the forum, but they were nowhere to be seen, and there are questions with datasets or swirl token that date back years without replies. Overall, I highly recommend spending your money somewhere else. Perhaps downloading swirl alone with all its free materials without going through this course is a good start.  ",1

The assignments are also awful, the test questions are poprly written, the R dataframes have errors in the name of the variables, the forum is outdated (since the last comments observed correspod to 2016)

I thought Swirl was a really good tool as well. The Week 02 Swirl assignment was more time consuming than the others and the Week 04 quiz which required hands on problem solving was very good and an excellent review of the materials. I would emphasize to future students to review the online textbook and to be prepared for Google Searching in order to answer some of the questions especially from Week 02 - 04. In other words, not everything one needs to pass this course is solely contained within the weekly chapters nor the suggested textbook. I assume however; that this is by design to stretch the student and to force them to put time into learning and understanding the materials and searching the Internet for additional help. Bravo!",5

4323,The R Programming Environment by Johns Hopkins University,Michael F,"May 3, 2022","This course basically consists of reading the book, Mastering Software Development in R, that is available via LeanPub as well as at https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/. (Starting with the fourth course in the specialization, the authors didn't even bother to enter the content into the course and instead you read a paragraph or two and then click the link to finish reading what's at bookdown.org!) Though the bookdown.org link has a December 2020 date, the course feels dated. I'm glad to have completed this course, but the second one has left me waiting for several weeks for a peer review. I'd recommend you complete this and later courses as an audit, at least in your mind, since it's highly likely that it will take weeks or months for you to get the peer reviewers needed to finish the course. I'm disappointed in Coursera continuing to offer this course and specialization; it's a trap!

It's a great way to learn how to use the console and specifics for R that would be similar in Python or Java (or any other language really). However, the final quiz in week 4 took everything to a whole new level of difficulty.

4458,Principles of fMRI 2 by Johns Hopkins University,Harley G,"Oct 24, 2022","I think this is a great course for an overview of fMRI in experimental studies. I love how the course makes fMRI analyses engaging and mostly digestable. The fact that they return to the same fMRI pipeline over multiple modules makes it really reinforce some of the central themes of conducting fMRI experiments. I find that Tor Wager gives great examples from real research studies.  Though Martin Linquist is obviously a brilliant statistician, I think he often gets too technical and glosses over jargon too quickly. This makes it difficult to learn. I've had trouble sometimes keeping up with the material when certain jargon is not spelled out always. I was also hoping to see real fMRI data in some sort of programming software that might make it a bit more hands on. Though, this is a good introductory course if you are already familiar with statistics, and have read a handful of fMRI papers. It may be too technical to people who are completely new to fMRI. All in all, great work.",4
4459,Principles of fMRI 2 by Johns Hopkins University,Jan S,"Jan 20, 2017","Still very good course with a lot to offer especially parts covering new methods. The only downside for me were the mathematical parts by Martin which got complex, messy and seemed to be explained not as clear as in previous course.

4460,Principles of fMRI 2 by Johns Hopkins University,Anirban S,"May 19, 2020",The course assignments were bit easy and it would be good to provide more thought provoking exercises. The explanations by Dr. Tor Wager was unsatisfactory many a times. The course can be made practical oriented where the students get to implement the algorithms learnt.

There's additional reading from pytorch manual. BERT and you can google the concept yourself, so it's not like it's impossible to understand, but you need to spend significant more time to do your reading.

Basically you can find the material, i.e, those grammar and function on the web. Using BERT to train is also easy to find on the web. The course simply put a web based tutorial into a video.
I think what a learner need is to further explain what those are doing behind the scene in certain depth but in a relatively easy way. The course should provide more on in-depth understanding (e.g., feature based vs. fine tuning, what layers are changed, etc.), instead of just stacking code (which in essence just directly import bert model).

I found myself having to pause the video a lot to look up code syntax lest it becomes a typing exercise. The Rhyme platform for assignments is nice in concept (side by side notebooks) but is barely usable in practice. Typing was laggy and it won't allow cut and paste which is really silly given how much code is over copied to be modified (e.g. train vs validation).

The professor was knowledgeable, but was difficult to understand and spoke quickly. Even the transcript had the words [INAUDIBLE] listed multiple times because he was so difficult to understand. There were no slides, so note taking was difficult. The course also requires paying $25 for an Excel Add-In, which was not mentioned before enrolling in the course. The Excel Add-In is a different version from the version used in the video, so it was very difficult to follow along because the screens and outputs were different. I also had an issue with the Excel Add-In that made some of my work late because the issue could not be resolved quickly. The Analytic Solver (the Add-Inrepresentative said the problem was on their end, and had to fix the issue himself. Overall I was extremely disappointed and would not recommend this course to anyone.

The lecturer goes through the concepts with no explanation or illustration. As a result, it was hard to understand the significance and applicability of the concepts taught. It was also very hard to catch what he was saying as his voice was not clear and no slides were provided. Further, no answer key was provided for the assignments and quizzes - we wont even know why we got the question(s) wrong and what should be the correct step(s). The final assignment/quiz was kind of a repeat of the first four quizzes/assignments using a different set of data. While I appreciate that this is to give us more practice, it wasn't very useful as the lack of answer key for the first four assignments/quizzes meant that we couldn't quite know the reason for getting certain question(s) wrong earlier on.

Being a part of the specialisation, it is necessary to pass this course. However, the answers of the quiz are also sometimes not correct.

2) The whole concept is based on XLMINER tool, which is free for 2 weeks. The tool is upgraded but the course material didn't.
3) Quiz questions and answers, not sure if those are ever verified. Its very specific to older version of XLMiner tool.
4) Not much support from moderator.",1

Week 4 module is too complicated to be covered in a 5 minute video. Many concepts should be explained in detail with examples. The teacher doesn't have a very easy accent to understand and there are many occasions when some really difficult concepts are covered in less than a minute.

 I took the Advanced Business Analytics Specialization  as a full time student. I finished the first four courses in more or less 3 weeks. In the last course needed to take the Specialization Certificate, the Advanced Business Analytics Capstone, the assignments of the course during the 2nd-3rd-4rth week were locked until 20 December - 5 January.

In the forum of the class there are more than 20 moderators, none of them has even one reply in anything. I made a thread, nonone replied to me. I contacted the customer service, they told me that they are sorry and they cannot change it. 
This is not a policy of an educational institute, this is an attitude that wants to take only your money. If you want your certificate, come back after two months AND KEEP PAYING!!

I've had to resolve these on my own, because neither forums, Coursera, or Frontline Solvers customer care could help.",3
4587,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Jordan H,"Sep 1, 2018","The professor does not explain the concepts well enough, to be quite honest. I have simply used his videos as a way to Wikipedia the concepts to actually understand what he is trying to explain.

4588,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Naveed T,"Nov 12, 2016","While the content (common predictive regression and classification algorithms and tools like XLMiner) was useful, little to no support was provided in the forums. The assignments in Week 3 and Week 4 in particular were either vague or had errors that nobody double checked and course-takers had to use trial and error approach to get answers right.",2
4589,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Jennifer Z,"Jun 6, 2018","Lots of info in 4 short weeks... the instructor did a good job of getting through it. I had issues with neural networks in XLMiner -- particularly, boosting and bagging; my in-Excel XLMiner wouldn't run models without terminating with an error. Using the in-the-cloud version of XLMiner was better because the menus matched what the instructor was showing in the videos (my desktop version did not).  However, I never was able to get the right answer on any neural network boosting or bagging questions on any quiz, though I got all the other questions right - creating decision trees or logistic regression models through XLMiner, even boosting/bagging decision tree models, both Classify and Predict.  There was zero traffic in the discussion forums (people were begging people to grade their peer assignments so they could get a grade) so there was zero response to my pleas for assistance. It was pretty frustrating.  I finally got through the class because getting everything right except neural network boosting/bagging questions enabled me to squeak through with a passing score. I hate not knowing what I was doing wrong though.  Perhaps the instructor's version had different default values than the version I was using. Oh well.  It's in the past :)",4
4590,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Antonio J A G,"Dec 31, 2020","I loved the course. The explanations were very accurate and easy to understand. But, I consider that using XLMiner is not the best software approach. I understand that R or Python may imply some problem to people with no programming skills, but it's easier to reproduce results. XLMiner has different versions (and the tutorials are not aligned with latest versions) and is also dependant of the Office version. Thus, some answers must be given in a flip-of-a-coin approach.",4
4591,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,John T,"Mar 30, 2017","This course has great content and I believe the professor is very knowledgeable about this subject matter.  However, at times, it can be very difficult to understand what he is saying.  I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying.  This is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video.  I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty.",3
4592,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Lance R,"Jan 3, 2018","This course gave me a good understanding of the typical analytic tools used when doing predictive study. It has helped set the direction for my future business analytics study (don't expect to master all the topics in one short course!). If you don't already have a background in basic statistics you will probably struggle to understand much of the material. By basic I'm speaking of things such as basic hypothesis testing, error types, z scores, measures of variation and central tendency, confidence intervals, basic probability, basic understanding of logarithms and exponents.

4595,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Mark H,"Aug 16, 2019","A challenging course, the most challenging I've had on Coursera to-date. The quiz questions really make certain that you have listened to and absorbed the course material. You will get full marks if you follow the instructions given in the videos regarding how to use the software, but you still need to do independent thought and analysis. Overall, I liked the course.
The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is the software package used for the course. I am on a Mac, and the software works best with Windows & excel. There is a web interface and Office 365 Extension for MacOs, but it is clunky.
Also, software costs $25 for 140 day license, and I am not certain how I feel about that. It would be better I think to design the course around R/Python, or to choose a software package that is free without time limitation (restricted functionality is fine, but work the course to operate within the free tier). That being said, I don't know how to do that either, and I am sure the instructors would have chosen that route if it was easier to teach that way on a MOOC.",4

Although it was hard to keep up with the teacher and his English, I managed to write notes using the text under the video. Later, reading the notes was okay since everything had more sense. I had to do some extra Google search since the explanations were not enough for me. 
But the assignments and tests with the sample databases were the best. They really made me think and gave me a real foundation in my knowledge.  
I am sad that XL Miner (Solver) is only 15 days and wished that the teacher would put a replacement tool we could use instead if the free subscription ends. 
Much work should be done to improve. ",4

But there are quite a few things that are too annoying to accept. First: The XLMiner-Tool might be a good idea but does not exist in the version used in recording (2014/15). Second: I choose not to install the current addon offered by the XLMiner Company solver.com because my antivirus alerted me multiple times. I do not care if these warnings are justified or not but this is a no go. Third Issue: even if your are trying to bypass XL-Miner with R or Python (which are not part of the program) in Week 3 and 4 you will run into unclear question in the application assignments. Fourth issue: due to the bad user experience, the time spend enlarges unnecessarily.
I have tried it as part of Coursera Plus an UC Boulders good reputation as an entry to the field her on coursera but am mostly disappointed. As of yet (Week 4) I am not sure if I really want to put any more time into it and will most likely switch to another course.",2

I had to go 2-3 times through a course to catch everything in the lecture.

The lecturer was hard to understand a lot of the time. He went past some important points at light speed and it was very hard to pick up certain concepts. Hard to take it in at times.  
Repeating what others have said - I really didn't like having to use a specific software package rather than a generic package. XLminer can be obtained on a 14 day trial, however the course is intended to be 4 weeks long, so either do the course faster (like I did) or pay for a package that you will most likely never use again. The course is, to a large extent, a tutorial on XLminer and it's fair to say that most people that do this course will never use it again.

1. The course was recorded in 2015/2016 and the XLMiner add-in for Excel has been updated, it is no longer called XLMiner.
2. The course content is superficial - there are just approximately 30 minutes of video for each module. No concepts are explained, instead just number crunching is taught.
3. No answers to quizzes are provided so one doesn't know what the correct answer should have been. This does not make for effective teaching and learning.
4. The instructor speaks too fast and reads from a script. Again a huge problem when trying to follow his videos.
If this wasn't a required course in the Advanced Business Analytics Specialization I would have dropped this course. As it is, this course took me forever to finish as it made for some extremely frustrating moments.

4618,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Jessica B,"Nov 2, 2016","This course starts very simply with data clean up (almost too simply!), but then goes DEEP into the weeds of regression and fails to explain how to apply these complex concepts to any real world application.  For example, if I build a regression model, how might I use it in my analytics role at work and explain the results to my stakeholders?  How do i interpret the results of the regression for making informed business decisions?  How do I predict an outcome with a Tree or Neural Network?  I found the instructor very hard to follow/understand (thank goodness for the written transcripts).

opposed to doing the models in Python which would require the ability of the

Sometimes the quizes or assignments are not direct related to the lecture, however you can get to the point thinking a little. Will be important to update the XL Miner explanations because the software is currently more up to date than was shown. Additionally, even we get lot of practical exercises where you can identify robustness and types of models, for me is not still clear how to get a predictive model for my daily use. Expect to cover that on further lectures. ",4
4690,Predictive Modeling and Analytics by University of Colorado Boulder,Eric Z,"Apr 11, 2019","I really enjoyed this course, but I did struggle more than I should have with the software tools.  In many cases, my version of the tool (the latest) did not match the instructor's version, and I worked to translate my version to his, and that's not a good use of my time.  That said, the material was interesting, and the professor did a great job presenting it.  I would recommend the course, but I would recommend that you learn to get the results not just in XL Miner, but in R or some other software, as well",4

The only thing I would tweak is not telling what function to use in the questions - instead, putting it in a helpful note if the student chooses to use it. What I've been doing, since I want to see if I understand when to use what function, is try and skip over them.

In the last course needed to take the Specialization Certificate, the Advanced Business Analytics Capstone, the assignments of the course during the 2nd-3rd-4rth week were locked until 20 December - 5 January. That means that I had to wait more than one month, and pay 2 more subscriptions to Coursera!!! In the forum of the class there are more than 20 moderators, none of them has even one reply in anything. I made a thread, nonone replied to me. I contacted the customer service, they told me that they are sorry and they cannot change it. 
This is not a policy of an educational institute, this is an attitude that wants to take only your money. If you want your certificate, come back after two months AND KEEP PAYING!!

4959,Business Analytics for Decision Making by University of Colorado Boulder,Anastasios B,"May 2, 2021","Overall enjoyable, but there were two main issues with the course. The first is that it is heavily dependent on the ASP software/plug-in. While you can access a free trial, it limits the simulation runs you can perform, and it also doesn't help once that trial is over. I think the course could be improved by examining how to work with some techniques in standard Excel. Much of what the ASP does is behind the scenes and the course videos focus more on setting it up than on what it is doing/how it works. That last point leads into my second disappointment with the course -- it just felt a bit short/rushed. The lessons after cluster analysis seem to delve less deeply into the material. I'm not sure if that is just due to complexity of the work underlying methodologies covered, but it does make me wonder what we're meant to walk away with as students. The first course in the specialization from Boulder seemed to have much more material and yet, was not dealing with as complex or hands-on items as this one. It felt as if the meat of this course should've been more than that of the first course.",3
4960,Business Analytics for Decision Making by University of Colorado Boulder,Steve R,"Oct 26, 2020","I thought the material covered in the course was interesting and useful. However I must dock points because of issues with the Analytic Solver Platform as follows:
1) The trial version we used for the course had a limit on Trials in simulations. This limit made it impossible to achieve the same results as the professor in his examples and on assignments/quizzes. Many times in the quizzes, I had to simply guess an answer because it was impossible to recreate the simulation.
2) The trial was only for a limited time, and it expired before I finished the Week 4 course work.",3

For instance, the number of trials for a simulation recommended by the professor (and emphasised continuously) is 10,000, at the same time ASP trial version limit is 1,000. Now I need to try all the practical tasks with any other alternative analytics tools which mean additional time (and might be more money) which I invested already.",3
4962,Business Analytics for Decision Making by University of Colorado Boulder,Lawrence G D,"Oct 31, 2020","Requires use of proprietary software that comes with a limited free trial that is difficult to install and couldn't even solve one of the problems in the quiz due to restrictions in the free trial capabilities.

4966,Business Analytics for Decision Making by University of Colorado Boulder,Andres C M,"Oct 3, 2020","Read before taking the course. Explanations, cases and data for the course are great. The main problem is the analytical solver platform (ASP). The course counts on you using ASP and gives you instructions on how to access it, the problem is the conditions mentioned (free access for a semester) are either a lie on the part of the providers of the ASP from the start or conditions have changed since the courses inception. What ends up happening is this specialization covering 5 courses, and thus, approximately 5 months cannot be completed in the 15 days the free trial for the app gives you, after which it asks you to pay up a not small sum, even if youre purchasing the student license. New account creation has been down for weeks on the ASP site, so you cant even access it by creating multiple accounts with different emails, and on top of that the program itself just wont work like intended for some of its functions. I tried using excel 2013, excel 2019, excel 365 online and it just wont work, so I just couldent complete many activities that required something more than the default solver add in excel has already installed.

It is definitely nice to deal with topics such as grid search or scikit-learn, but I think the course only covers these topics in a nutshell, it is more superficially discussed. If you are interested in Machine Learning, you should definitely bring your own motivation to dive deeper into those topics.. Also, Dr. Koop speaks very very fast though.. I attended courses by Andrew Ng, his courses provide a way better comprehensibility for listeners. The notebooks are a bit weird, very easy to understand and are hence not challenging. If you really want to understand the algorithms deeply, I don't think this course is the right one. But all in all, I completed the course, but I don't think I was able to understand everything by taking the course only.",3
5093,Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised Learning Tip to Tail by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute,Luiz C,"Sep 11, 2019","Had higher expectations. Concepts not well and clearly explained. Notebooks bugged (we are actually warned about it), but even so not so interesting. Plan of the Course not so rational: why include the one section about model parameters on its own, rather than for each model.
I give it a 3 as the Instructor is smily and engaging, but it's a 2.5 mark (I have done another ML MOOC on another concurrent platform about the same topic, and the quality was much higher)",3

I have learned quite a lot and I believe, now, I have a solid general understanding of some of the most common ML algorithms. The instructor, Anna Koop is very knowledable and she has a very clear way of explaining the concepts. The reason why I haven't rated it 5-star is because the course is not really designed around practice. It is rather conventional in the sense that the instructor takes the central stage and students don't get to practice much. Quizzes are good, but they are far from being enough to give learners actual experience of ""doing"" machine learning. I am aware of the vastness of the field, and maybe that's why they kept the course intructor centered, but I still expect courses to push learners more in trying out the methods themselves and learning by doing. Still, the course is very beneficial and has valuable content. It is a great knowledge source as well. Warmest regards.  ",4

5169,Advanced Deep Learning Methods for Healthcare by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Ernest W,"Feb 16, 2023","I think it's a good addition to two previous courses in specialization.
It's short and sometimes the lecturer tries to explain too many things at once. It's not a course to learn things from scratch, furthermore it would be difficult to apply knowledge from notebooks elsewhere if you aren't experienced. I wish about an assignment about GNN / GANS / VAE, all these things are interesting but only briefly covered. 
I've never heard of Graph Neural Network. Well, every neural network actually is a graph, didn't know it's a separate kind of network.",4

5183,Introduction to Applied Machine Learning by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute,Sj,"Aug 23, 2019","The specialization based on this course sounds good. If the specialization delivers on what this course promises, it could be extremely valuable. However, I do not like how this introductory course was used in adjunction with the free 7-day trial. This course merely introduces important concepts while the rest of the courses would be the ones actually helping us learn the material in-depth, assuming they are able to deliver on that. I don't personally like how this 3-hour course just introducing terminology, even if it was informative,  was released with the free trial for the entire specialization. I can't judge the specialization by this course.",3

5319,"Classification Trees in Python, From Start To Finish by Coursera Project Network",Erick M F d S,"May 16, 2020","Short, but good content. Still lots of problems with the Rhyme platform.
The main problem with the guided project was that the Rhyme platform is still problematic: the video playback was constantly being interrupted for buffering, especially at higher playback speeds (my internet connection is good enough for 4k streaming), the cloud desktop for the Jupyter notebook is quite laggy, doesn't allow  copy and paste between cloud and own computer; the whole UX of a single browser window for both video and remote desktop is very awkward and inflexible; the video playback was paused every time the browser window was out of focus, as when I was writing some notes on another window. Finally, I couldn't easily download the completed code, for use in my own projects, thus reducing my capacity to reuse what was learned without extensive notes. 
 Guided projects are a great idea. Not sure I would pay U$ 10 for simple projects when there are similar excellent code freely available on Kaggle or github, but Coursera's selection of content might make it worth. But the current performance of Rhyme is still insufficient for a paid service. I can get better service out of Google Colab, for free!",4

I'd totally recommend this course to any beginner looking to quickly pick up tf probability.",5
5418,Probabilistic Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Nathan W,"Apr 16, 2021","I really wanted to like this class. I got a lot out of the first two, but very little from this one.  As others have hinted, this class is really not like the first two, it is much less general.. it does not just require stats knowledge, but is framed for stats people by stats people, using a library written by someone who does not seem to be clear on python or OOP libraries.  There is very little discussion about what you are doing or why, instead treating it like an extension of a stats course where you are learning the function names for various combinations of techniques, but is not really an introduction to the mechanics of the library or of the techniques, with lots of links to 'go read this research paper'.  Great for academics studying stats, but the utility to a more general deep learning audience (like the other 2 classes) is limited.
it would probably do well as a stand alone class, but feels out of place in this specialization.   The actual topics are really fascinating and worth learning, but the framing is a real barrier to that.
but others got a lot out of it, so take my review with a grain of salt.  ",3
5419,Probabilistic Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Carl T,"Oct 26, 2020","Taught concepts were highly interesting and the video lectures were really great. They were very clear and pedagogical. Most TAs had pretty good walkthroughs too.
Why I cannot rate a perfect 5/5 is because many of the lab assignments contained warts and/or misleading instructions that need polish. However, as the course organizer has been frequenting the discussion forum and been very quick to adjust instructions when pointed out by participants, I'm sure the course has already improved greatly. My experience was a bit confused at times however, and I wasn't sure if I had done mistakes or if the automatic judge has bugs, at times.
Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a modern API for generative modelling. I'm sure I'll come back to the more difficult concepts like the autoregressive trick in normalizing flows, and the change of variable formula, and hopefully having done this course will make those concepts a bit more familiar next time around for me.

5421,Probabilistic Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Omkar K,"Mar 10, 2021",Only reason I gave 3 stars is it is definitely NOT a 5 week course. It took me a good 2 months (with a week or so of being pulled off to work commitments). It covers a lot of concepts which need a ton of background. It is dependent on the previous two TF2.0 specialization courses but this specialization is sorely missing one more 5 week course in between the 2nd and 3rd course and that is the Statistics Concepts. Without this I felt that I could not take advantage of the great introduction to all the tools in the Prob deep learning with TF2.0 course.,3

However, this balance of duality is not perfect for a leaner who had already familiar with it, also not friendly for those who are not.

I like the Quiz format, including expanding the number of choices for the multiple choice selections, but the grading was confusing.  For Quiz 3, some questions came back with multiple ""Well Done"" comments, even when I had not selected the answer for which I was being praised.  I also was told I made errors on the same question....   and this was after I answered the question (Question 2, on R generic functions) the exact same as I had answered it when I took the course earlier this year.
I was not a fan of not having to take a picture to submit work, so I am pleased that is no longer a requirement.  I hope the typing pattern match is sufficient to affirm identity.
I have one comment on content specific to this class.  Week 3 content lacks relevancy to the project and data products in general.  I agree that knowledge of R packages, classes, and methods is an important part of understanding R.  I am not sure where that fits in the Data Science curriculum as a whole, though.  Maybe expanding the curriculum to include a second, more advanced R class, with a project to write our own methods, build an R package, or do something with yhat.  That would assign relevant work to reinforce the lectures.
I would be happy to do further beta testing.

5464,Developing Data Products by Johns Hopkins University,Henk S,"Dec 6, 2015","This is my comment as a beta tester:
1) The changes to the lessons have changed the course for the better.
2) If you want to be factually right than the statement that Bootstrap is a style should be changed on a few places. Bootstrap itself is not a style, although it is used as a style guide for the development of products. Obviously this is not a big issue and people that delve into will find the facts easily. 
Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS, and JS front-end framework with a strong support for themes which people also call styles. Many themes/styles are available to build responsive, mobile-first web sites. Bootstrap was created by a designer and a developer at Twitter in mid-2010 and was released to the public in August 2011. It has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source 
projects in the world. Bootstrap has a few easy ways to quickly get started,
 each one appealing to a different skill level and use case. ",5

While not strictly part of creating a data product, those are great things to have on the resume. I was pleased to see the capabilities of Plotly and will certainly use that.

5593,Graph Analytics for Big Data by University of California San Diego,Alexander W,"Sep 8, 2020","I had the pleasure of being introduced to graph analytics, Neo4j and GraphX through Spark by this course. Some of the most interesting content was why graphs, social media graphs, human information networks, visualizing graphs, how the volume impact the graphs, walks in the graphs, Dijkstra’s algorithm, robustness and concequences of disconnecting a connected graph or communities. I think there are some challenges running the scripts with Neo4j. It was not always easy to answer the questions with some typos but instead you had to think what the instructor want to achieve to get it through. Before, I signed up for this course, I had heard about the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) from my earlier studies here in Sweden, within a positive manner, and now I took the opportunity to study online through Coursera. I am grateful for that, the structure of the course content, new concepts and the explanations from Mr Amarnath Gupta (week 1-3, 5), Mr Jeff Sale (week 4) and Ms Christine Kirkpatrick (week 5). I give my highest recommendation to others to take this course and sending five big yellow stars.

5595,Graph Analytics for Big Data by University of California San Diego,Vincent R,"Jun 3, 2018",This is the more challenging course of the Specialization. The course is not as well built as the other ones. Week 1 does not include any lessons; week 5 is very fastidious and time consuming. The course should mention up front to run the Cloudera VM with one CPU only to avoid getting wrong metro vertex results and crash the system when using the filter method. The author may want to consider using Python instead of Scala as Python was used in all the previous courses of the specialization.,4

There were a lot of new concepts for me and it was a lot of information to take in but it was explained very well. The hands-on exercises in Graphx introduced a lot of unfamiliar code and seemed very technical but I believe that it is needed. This portion of the course might require more time to digest but I believe it was absolutely necessary. All in all, loved it!",4

I understand these complex platforms are more aimed to complex and dense scenarios such as those from Facebook and the like, and it could also be useful to learn small alternatives for smaller deployments. Very interesting though!",4

The reason I did not give it five stars because I thought the last week of the course was not up to par with the first 4 weeks.

Related on this course, my favorite part: 
- Windows, watermarks, and triggers;
- Sources and Sinks; 
- Schemas;
- Best practices;
- SQL (for people that already are using BigQuery this will be a game changer). 

Also I've noted that Java it's the way to go for full features in Beam/Dataflow (although for me the syntax of python looks way prettier). 

Also I have a question: with ""dataflow sql"" you have less features than using java or python ?! Also Google have plans to bootstrap ""Dataflow SQL"" with more features?

5991,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Max K,"Jan 31, 2021",  Never recieved my grade. Contacted coursera support. They demanded another motnh of payment for the course or else I will not get my grade. Terrible practice and this is used to punish people that finish their course early since coursera will simply wait until you pay another month before the start grading your paper!  ,1
5992,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Pengfei Z,"Jul 9, 2020","The course is really well-organized. The videos are relatively short but very clear and concise.

5995,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Erik B,"Aug 2, 2020","Very nice introduction to tensorflow 2.0 with focus on keras.  I already knew keras from tensorflow 1 so this was very useful. Still I thought this course was a little too basic for me to get a certificate. I used it as preparation for the other course ('customizing your models with tensorflow 2').  Doing this course quickly at least gives me a good background to do the second one. 
There were some small errors in the course. It looks like tensorflow has adapted their APIs so that in the model checkpointing you specify the number of batches and not the number of samples. Also, there is a current bug in tensorflow 2.2.0 (and 2.3.0), that specifying {batch} in the path of the checkpoint no longer works. Also, there is another bug in tensorflow 2.3.0 that has apparently broken saving and loading of complete models  using model.save() and load_model().
Going to do the second course now with the aim to get the certificate. ",5
5996,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Harshwardhan P,"Aug 30, 2020","I think it is an absolutely incredible course for anyone who wants to make the jumpy from TF 1.x to TF 2 (or has the knowledge of Deep Learning ideas and is looking to learn the TF 2 framework to apply them). The content is planned out perfectly for learners, the tutorials and assignment introduce and understand important ideas from the tensorflow 2 framework.
Finally, the most amazing thing about this course is the Capstone project. It just strikes the perfect balance on the difficulty scale. It will keep you engaged but at the same time it will not be very difficult either. The content in the course is geared towards preparing the learner to be able to do the project with ease and it does serve as a culmination of the skills used learnt in the course.",5
5997,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Raimondo M P,"Aug 26, 2020","This is a truly outstanding course that teaches you the basics of Tensorflow 2 using the Keras API. (There is a more advanced course if you want to deep dive into Tensorflow2)
One minor quirk is that instructors almost never answer questions on the forum. Nonetheless, it is worth the money spent if you plan to start designing Neural Networks with Tensorflow 2 framework.
The Capstone project is really satisfying since it gives you a lot of flexibility on how you can to complete it.",5
5998,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Abdelrhman H,"Aug 4, 2020",This is such an amazing course. It's very simple but accomplishes what it's supposed to accomplish. I've taken the andrew NG course for deep learning so I know the theory and this  finally made me understand what I've been writing and allowed me to express some of what I think in terms of code instead of only having the theoretical model. and even more stuff that the other course didn't cover in terms of tensorflow,5
5999,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Ihor F,"Jul 30, 2020","A good course for beginners in TF, though familiarity with deep learning is assumed.

6032,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Michael D,"May 14, 2021","The perfect course to follow up the Deep Learning Specialization. I left that specialization feeling like I had an acceptable academic understanding of deep learning, but that I would be unable to apply it in practice. This course was great for solidifying that pragmatic component.
I read some of  the most helpful comments before starting and one of the biggest frustrations was the auto-grader failing. That was not my experience at all. As of this post (5/2021) the grading system worked completely fine for me via Coursera's notebook system.
A concern among other TF specializations was that they did not provide any information that could not be gained outside the doc examples. For this first course, at least, I found the material well exceeded the explanations in the TensorFlow/Keras docs in terms of quality. The labs were very thoughtfully structured and provided the right amount of application to cement the concepts mentally.
tldr found this course to be very worth the time and money",5
6033,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Мартынов А А,"Oct 8, 2020","This is just a wonderful course!
Previously I've taken well-kown Machine Learning course and Deep Learning specialization by Andrew Ng. After completing these courses, I had the feeling that I had received a good knowledge of the theoretical aspects of Machine and Deep Learning, but I had no understanding of how to make some even simple models from start to finish (I am not criticizing these courses, most likely the problem is in me).
And this course was a real godsend for me. This course is completely dedicated to practice, this is exactly what I needed. The information presented in it is absolutely clear and contains everything you need to complete programming tasks and to start the independent development of simple models in tensorflow.
No doubt, 5 stars!",5
6034,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Ernest W,"Apr 19, 2023","Beginning is too basic for me but I like this course because it's a well structured tutorial-like course if you want to learn Tensorflow. First course is about Sequential API, second about Functional and Subclass API and the last about Tensorflow probability library. 
It's not going to teach you basic concepts of deep learning like deeplearning.ai specialization but this specialization  (its first two courses) is significantly better in explaining how to actually code with Tensorflow - it introduces very early the callbacks and optimization techniques directly into code labs in a way you can see and understand what happens.",5
6035,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Felipe C,"Jul 29, 2020","I really liked this course. The pace is very good. The focus is also great.
The final project (Capstone Project) is really good practice, I'm not super experienced in ML so doing a kind of ""real world hands on project"" fell great, even if I spent a lot of time doing it (I made an initial wrong assumption about the data structure which made the model trainings take forever).
You are going to need to know about Python and Numpy, maybe a little Pandas too.
My only constructive criticism would be that it would be great if you got a good mic… these makes videos much more pleasurable. Audio isn't great.",5
6036,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Ginger d R,"May 24, 2023","While not super hard, it is definitely a lot more challenging than the introductory course on tensorflow from deeplearning.ai. The structure of the course is excellent, and the capstone programming assignment is actually decently hard.
I also liked that the programming exercises aren't fill-in-the-blanks as they are on deeplearning.ai, and require some thought. This course deserves way more students than have currently taken it. Easily one of my top 5 courses on coursera.",5
6037,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,p.w.ouwehand,"Dec 23, 2020","Excellent course on the Keras API of TensorFlow 2 for those who already know about fully connected and convolutional neural nets. If you don't have that background just yet, I recommend the first four courses of DeepLearning.AI's Deep Learning Specialization for a good introduction. 
The ""Getting Started with TensorFlow 2"" is a step up in technical difficulty, and you'll be able to construct your own neural networks with ease and speed once you've completed this course.",5
6038,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Tse-Shao C,"Feb 16, 2022","This is an excellent course teaching you how to use Tensorflow 2 from scratch with step-by-step instruction.  They provide just enough knowledge you should have for starting using TensorFlow 2.  To start this course, you should have some basic understanding of deep learning since they assume you already know these.  I enjoy learning from this group.  I highly recommend it.  Denefinally, take the second course - Customising your models with TensorFlow 2.  ",5
6039,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Alejandro D G,"Oct 25, 2020","Great practical course: if you have previous understanding of the Deep Learning models (for this course, multi layer perceptrons and convolutional neural network, for which I recommend to do before the Deep Learning specialization from deeplearning.ai) this course is very good for learning the practical implementations in the tensorflow2's sequential API. Great programming materials, videos and exercises. ",5
6040,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Mark N,"May 1, 2022","I absolutely enjoyed this course.  I liked the mix of lecture and TA/mentor time, the exercises done alongside our TAs/mentors were extremely instructive and helpful.  The textbook recommendations were great.  The weekly exercises were well-designed.  I highly recommend this course, and I am looking forward to our next course in the sequence.  Thank you for putting together such a fine class.",5
6041,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Feng J,"Dec 26, 2020","This is one of the best course I have taken in coursera ！！！ The course is very well designed. I have learned a lot about the sequential model in tf2.0, I also build the deep learning model by myself through the practice in this courser. And finally gather all of the knowledge in the final capstone project. I look the video lectures again after one month time, and understand it more clearly.",5
6042,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Maxim V,"Apr 7, 2021","Initially I wanted to do only Probabilistic DL (3rd course) because this material is not taught anywhere else as far as I am aware, but I learned quite a bit from other two courses as well even though I thought I knew the material. The entire specialisation is highly recommended, very good quality and very relevant content. The best of 2020 on Coursera, in my estimation.",5
6043,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Islomjon S,"Dec 4, 2020","It was incredible experience to study TF 2 with this course. Progressively, we studied each component of Tensorflow to build eloquent ANNs. However, it was very shallow application of Tensorflow in just using CNN (which they explained 100%), it would be very good if they also showed some other architectures too.",5

6046,Getting started with TensorFlow 2 by Imperial College London,Goh K L,"Dec 13, 2021",This course is a good complement to the courses offered by Deeplearning.ai in terms of focusing on the basic neural network coding.

1) A lot of practices: assignments, notebooks, capstone project.

6397,Nearest Neighbor Collaborative Filtering by University of Minnesota,Yonaton H,"Sep 22, 2019",There is good information in this course but there are so many problems in this course. There are major errors in the assignments and I was only about the get the right answers by reading the discussions on the message board. There are coding exercises but they expect you to write them in Java rather than a language used by data scientists such as Python or R. It is a good thing the made them optional.,3
6398,Nearest Neighbor Collaborative Filtering by University of Minnesota,Alex B,"Aug 26, 2019","This course is taught at a really low level. Exercises are in spreadsheets which are more or less useless for practicing scale data applications. Spreadsheets contain information that makes importation into numerical processing software such as Pandas in Python or dplyr in R needlessly difficult and assumes the user can't even apply the distance formula.
Videos contain useful information but require wading through a lot of garbage at a slow pace, not useful for practitioners.
Assignments are poorly worded and some terminology is used questionably or flexibly (see the word ""normalization""). Some assignments are so poorly done that there is an ongoing debate on the forums as to whether the autograder is messed up or the assignment instructions are messed up. 
The ""honors"" track programming assignments use some piece of software with questionable generalizability. If I ever see lens kit in my own data work environment I will come back an edit my review but I find it unlikely. Furthermore, Java is not commonly used for data science or machine learning purposes making these assignments inaccessible to many users. Personally, I write in Java but I didn't find it fulfilling to waste my time playing ""fill in the blanks"" or ""guess the library function"" which is overall uninstructive. 
Quiz assignments show true indications of the poor level of instruction. Recitation of pieces of information buried in 30 minutes videos that can be condensed into 5 are some of the finest examples of bad teaching. Regurgitating information found in required readings shows no level of comprehension of course material and is a severe disservice to students.
I will hope for better general coverage of recommender systems in the future in another course. Ideally using something applicable like Python, Scala (Spark), or even R.",1
6399,Nearest Neighbor Collaborative Filtering by University of Minnesota,Jack B,"Oct 25, 2017",The course is less helpful than the others in the specialty.

6442,Nearest Neighbor Collaborative Filtering by University of Minnesota,Andrew W,"Jan 21, 2018","Thank you for this course -- it opened my eyes to the universal applicability of recommender systems in tech applications. 
My feedback is that you could do more to tie the *implementation* to the theory and real-life applications you discuss. You have many great lectures talking about how these systems were implemented, qualitative differences, subtle differences, and interviewing people to give us perspectives. But then the videos on implementation (including working through the equations) are pretty sparse and short. I felt like I'm ""on my own"" to figure out how to go implement these in real life. The problem sets cover one test case, and that's it.  I think you could update the lectures to focus more on different algorithms / equations in different scenarios, rather than just talking qualitatively about them.  
Regardless thank you!  I deeply appreciate this course and what you've done.  I plan to help my Consulting clients directly based on what I learned from you. ",4

On the other hand, there is a lot of repeated material from the previous course. I do not know if they expect students to jump in at different parts of the specialization, but it seemed unnecessary. The rest of this review is a repeat of my review for the previous course, but still holds true in this course. The programming assignments are left almost completely to the students guessing what they're suppose to do with little direction. There is almost no feedback on how your code has performed, except to say that your code was wrong, which you already understand from not getting the points. While I was able to achieve a passing grade in this course, it was only because of the community of students that figured things out together, but with no other reliable way of figuring the material out. The code was also rife with bugs that weren't fixed for weeks while students tried and failed over and over again to pass assignments that they simply could not pass. It ended up wasting many hours of my time and, no doubt, other students' time.

On the one hand, they are quite simplistic and do not require understanding of the course material, the algorithms or the theory to be completed - one just needs to mechanically follow the code and write appropriate lines. On the other hand, the grading algorithms are sometime stuck on technicalities that are not relevant either understanding or programming but may require significant time to figure out the correct solution.

You will work with simple (and messy) tools which offer you the opportunity to get your hands dirty quickly. Most likely, you will not use these very tools later in your own research because they are just to limited and simple. Prof Hilbert is an entertaining lecturer and all the guest lectureres (or collaborators) in the specialization offer interesting insights. Be warned that the peer-review process might take a while (a couple of days). There are other learners but it seems that this course (and all courses of the specialization) are not that crowded.",4

6684,"Computational Social Science Methods by University of California, Davis",Bonny,"Sep 13, 2021","I’m so confused by all the glowing reviews of this course. Am I taking a different course than everyone else?

Perhaps my style of learning differs from most, but I’ve found this course ridiculous at times (with multiple in-video quiz answers revolving around silliness like, “Wait, I wasn’t paying attention….!!!!” And full of grammatical and spelling errors, I’m assuming to mimic text speak.

Casual doesn’t even begin to describe the teaching style. It’s hard to follow the instructor as he goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the course. There’s a lot of repetition for things that don’t require it (like what we’re going to cover). If you’ve got epilepsy or can’t handle lots of flashing, don’t watch the videos - there’s a lot of it, unnecessarily, from stock images.

I repeatedly felt like I was in a science world presentation for youth with lots of smoke bombs and “ooohs” but it all covered up the actual knowledge. I can’t imagine this course would ever be taught at university… and if it was, I’d ask for a refund.

I ended up reading the transcripts of every video and ignored 90% of it. Much of it was nonsensical. I understand the main instructor has English as a second language, which I love, but the phraseology left much to be desired. I’m older than the instructor, but I felt like I was back in high school with the “cool teacher” who just wanted to be liked, and did anything to keep students engaged with a topic that isn’t particularly engaging.

The difference here is that anyone taking this course chose to; we all need measurable skills to take away from a course and specialization like this. Smoke and mirrors, off topic and meandering 18-minute videos don’t cut it.",2
6685,"Computational Social Science Methods by University of California, Davis",Juan S A D,"Jun 15, 2021",Many of the general introductory videos were repetitive and did not provide new or useful information.

They don't touch the topic of computational social science until the fourth module. The lecture in the 4th module is verbose. I can get more informaiton on the subject from wikipedia and youtube. The 3rd module teaches how to scrape the web for data. I thought this could be one useful takeaway from the course. However, the scraper API that they want me to install asks for permission to use and change all my website data on Google Chrome. I don't trust that API. I do not recommend this course for anyone interested in learning anything serious here. If you want an overview of the topic, there are plenty of free resources.",1

It is taught by Professor Mannino who is very engaging as a lecturer showing up his sense of humour every time he says 'lets continue our fun with { subt..otals, etc} at the beginning of some videos in this course. The material requires more time to learn and so a weeks content here often means a week content rather than a day of work like with some other Coursera courses that I have studied.

in modules 3 and 4 videos were great but readings were so boring actually 
quizzes were nice
i hoped that readings were more organized and structured like detecting certain book and we stuck with it through the course 
the best thing in my opinion about the course is the discussion section , it was so helpful too me and tease me to continue the course till the end

Designing a survey framework is such an interesting and fascinating topic that it can be taught in quite fun-filled and engaging ways. But unfortunately this course was too boring and academic. Every thing they covered in the class could have been made much more interesting and application oriented for people who have been away from academia for sometime.

The discussion on the total survey error framework was particularly eye-opening. I think that my satisfaction on the course stems largely from reflecting through previous research experience, so I am not entirely sure if a similar level of benefit/satisfaction would be obtained by those students starting from scratch in this kind of research. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course to those who helped in conducting at least one survey research in the past. I am looking forward to complete the entire Specialization that this offering introduces.",5
6805,"Framework for Data Collection and Analysis by University of Maryland, College Park",Omotayo J (,"Jul 15, 2023","This course is very insightful and thorough. The only downside is that a lot of terms were not explained, even though it was an introductory course. The instructor communicated like she was speaking to professionals who are already versed with these terms, and that is the only downside of it. Every other thing is on point. So, keep in mind that you will have to do extra digging and learning yourself so that you can meet up to have a better comprehension of the explanation of the instructor. 
Above all, I say thank you to the instructor for the opportunity and privilege to take this course, even as I proceed to complete the other courses in this specialization. And I hope it gets better from here on.",5

I would have liked a more rigorous approach to introducing and defining concepts.  The last course on examples of surveys was pretty weak - with more work the instructor could have better linked the examples to concepts we had previously learned.  Instead she just did a rote report out of the purpose, design, and potential issues.  The slides had all the information she was going to share, she didn't add much value with her speaking.",3
6900,Data Mining Pipeline by University of Colorado Boulder,Cyrus E,"May 15, 2023","This course gives the strong impression that someone shoved the instructor into a closet and had her give a summary of a course she has taught well with student interaction at gunpoint. Occasionally she gets a chance to make a point where her investment in the field and how interesting her experience has been shines through the cracks in the surface we're shown. This makes the quality of the course overall a question of tragedy, as opposed to simply farce: it's demeaning to be offered this, but she deserved better than to be the face of the offering, too.
The subtitles/transcripts are machine-transcribed with no human intervention, which makes completing this course as someone who depends on transcripts for disability reasons insulting: I can't help but have feelings on what it implies about me that the material is treated with the care and quality assurance needed to leave in ""unsuccessful data mining task"" where the instructor presumably said ""a successful"". (It's also peppered with ""[inaudible]""s and ""[NOISE]""s, but hey, at least those are probably obstructing the understanding of the people who listen to the audio, too!)
Videos themselves are unstructured, wandering blocks of 33 to 47 minutes (other UCB courses, which also have transcripts that were seen by a living human at UCB at least once, divide topics into smaller videos for a Coursera-native format, which is much more effective both in delivering the material and in keeping instructors themselves on topic). The worst are the ones where there's the sense that someone specifically forced the instructor to attempt to recap a prerequisite course or three for the Coursera learners, such as the one that mushes up an introduction to data visualization and an overview of statistics to present a kind of sad porridge of classes I've taken and loved--and that UCB offers material for. 
This specialization sticks out in the context of the Data Science Masters program especially because the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing in it: the material isn't just low quality, it's as if it's been beamed in absentmindedly by low-fidelity transmission from a universe where the rest of the material doesn't exist. Which makes sense knowing that it's cross-listed from another, earlier program: I thought it might be reused material put together under duress at the beginning of pandemic lockdowns, and this may well also be the case, but it's *definitely* something assembled without care or skill in what's proven to be best practices in online course delivery and no existing structure of an imaginable online program and then wished good luck and launched out into the void. (I don't know what this says about the engineering MS. I hope its core courses measure up and it's just that data mining is an ancillary elective for engineering so it's a perfect storm of reasons to be bottom-shelf knock-off product kind of quality material produced and published.) 
I keep coming back to the injustice being done to the instructor: I'm angry on her behalf that *this* is the image of her and her competency being broadcast to the world by UCB, even more than on behalf of the disrespect it's doing to the overall fantastic programs it's listed in. My hope is to wait until I can enroll at UCB to do the interactive material so that I can at least talk to a human about the apparently catastrophically bad assignment design and grading systems--it's not surprising that the moving parts are as bad as their foundation, but the current utter annihilation of my faith in humanity in this vicinity was, for the record, achieved by the lecture material alone. I hate that I have to give this feedback for something so bad I can't imagine its creator willingly made it the way it is.
Coursera and UCB must retire this specialization immediately and recreate the material in a form that's up to their actual standards, does justice to the instructor, doesn't denigrate any student who subjects themself to it by proxy, and isn't humiliatingly inaccessible for something with what allege themselves to be subtitles. I am grieved that the following statement is accurate: calling this a course is a disgrace.",1
6901,Data Mining Pipeline by University of Colorado Boulder,Justin G,"Oct 2, 2023","This course was recently updated. I feel it's much better than the prior version. The videos are easier to follow, and the assignments are cleaned up as well.",5
6902,Data Mining Pipeline by University of Colorado Boulder,Lucas P,"May 7, 2023","I encountered several issues that made the course difficult to complete and left me feeling frustrated and unsupported.
Firstly, the lack of support was a major issue. There were no forums or discussion boards where students could ask questions or seek guidance from the instructor or peers. This lack of community made it feel like I was learning in isolation, which was demotivating and made it difficult to stay engaged.
Additionally, the instructions for the assignments were unclear and often left me confused about what was expected of me. This lack of clarity made it difficult to complete the assignments to the best of my ability and left me feeling unsure about whether I had done them correctly.
To make matters worse, the grader system was broken and often did not function correctly. This made it difficult to submit assignments and receive grades, which further added to my frustration.
Lastly, the lack of feedback from the instructor was disappointing. Despite several attempts to reach out, I received little to no feedback on my assignments or questions. This lack of engagement made it feel like the instructor was disinterested in my progress and did not care about my learning experience.
Overall, I would not recommend this course to others due to the lack of support, unclear instructions, broken grader system, and lack of feedback from the instructor.",1
6903,Data Mining Pipeline by University of Colorado Boulder,matt t,"Mar 10, 2023","This is the most poorly taught and administered course I can remember taking, definitely the worst in recent memory. I'm surprised an instructor that has a rating of 1.33/5 is still asked to teach (or provide content, I guess she doesn't really teach the course, just posts videos created a while ago). The programming assignments that you're graded on throughout the course have very little relevance to the content taught throughout: they're more of an intro to basic analysis & visualization using python & jupyter notebooks. The automated grading rubrics are ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE they are nowhere near robust enough for what they're designed, especially when you consider the terrible instructions provided for the assignment. For instance, don't use 'iloc' when using python dataframes(!) because the rubric can't handle it. Seriously?! Something that basic caused points deductions!!! I believe every single programming assignment has at least one function you have to write where the expected output per the docstring is a plot - but don't actually do it, can cause errors. These are just two small examples of many - your method for creating lists, how you treat variables, etc. can all cause errors that will result in losing points even if your code does exactly what's expected. After assignment 1 I posted in the forums, not a single reply. If you have to take this course as part of the MS-DS offered by CU I might try to wait and see if someone new teaches it in the future. If you're not going through the CU program definitely don't waste your time/money on this course, there are much better options out there. I'm genuinely shocked at how bad this course is.

6904,Data Mining Pipeline by University of Colorado Boulder,Nathan H,"Mar 22, 2022","I'm enrolled in the not-for-credit version of the course. 
I asked about a programming assignment that looks defective in the ""urgent help"" discussion forum a month ago, and still haven't seen a response.   So, I'm not entirely sure whether the course is defective or not, but it's pretty silly to put up an ""urgent help"" forum and then ignore it.
This course has required programming assignments that only give a score as feedback, and that seem to be unclear, incomplete, incorrect or misleading.
The coverage of material in the course also seems excessively basic and superficial.
