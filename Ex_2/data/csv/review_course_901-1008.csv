426,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,Edgar Q,"Apr 10, 2022","Weeks 1 through 4 of this course indicates a function of ""teaching"" the material and the theory of ETL processes and data models.

However, week 5 is the practical use of these teachings with no examples on how to actually do this process outside of the dry speakings and videos of Dr. Kahn. 

Dr. Kahn's presentation and reading ability is on full display, but what is not on full display is how to actually do what he is describing.  I feel it would be more beneficial on teaching these techniques and connecting the theory with application through practical quizzes at the end of week 1 through 4 instead of multiple choice quizzes.  

I also have issues with the quizzes that require an 80% to pass with only 6 questions where I had some answers marked ""incorrect"" when they weren't the ""most correct"" answer. This is not how the real world operates and definitely not how to teach a very practical subject matter. 

I have a BA in mathematics and have spent the last 10 years as a data analyst and taking this 6 course program to learn more about how to apply it to the healthcare field. I did not feel this course was well designed for coursera and clearly meant for an in-person classroom. I believe it would do the students taking this course to relook at how this topic is presented.

Also, it is necessary to relook at the websites provided in all the videos. I have found a key website to be out of date on ""Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Steps 1 and 2"" video in the FINAL week.

Having a student review 3 assignments is incredibly short sighted unless the final grade for ones own assignment is then averaged. Having a 3:1 grade:submitt just doesn't make sense.

This course DESPERATELY needs to be re-evaluated. The meat is there but not the potatoes.",2
427,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,Kabakov B,"Jan 13, 2020","Authors do not  give a damn about it, there are more water than in average PhD thesis  and as many practical skills as chicken has teeth. There are bloopers in  course video that no one bothered to reshoot. Course listeners must do  tasks, that should be done in SQL, in R and custom JAVA soft (which  produces xlsx as output) and submit answers in pptx (sic!) to be  peer-reviewed. Due to peer-review and lack of course listeners it could  be hard to meet deadlines (I submitted my final task 2 weeks ago with  forum campaign “let’s unite and help each other to review” but sill lack  reviewers.)
The  only thing that is theirs and hardly available opensource is clinical  models presentation but it is described in the same terms, but way  shorter, in the two articles of one of the course authors.",1
428,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,Nicholas S,"Mar 14, 2020","Don't believe what coursera says 
Coursera advertised the course as ""at your own place"" what a lie. After completing the course I had to pay another $100 just to wait for the final assignment to be marked to get my certificate. 
The courses for the specialisation keep getting pushed back, so you have to shell out a subscription for another month while you wait for them to come out. 
I've spent far more time paying just to wait than actually doing any of the course materials.",1

430,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,Allison B,"Jul 25, 2019","Teaching was excellent, but I feel that the peer reviewed feedback model for the final project may not be the most helpful since they're the only ones looking at your work (as opposed to an instructor).

431,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,William H,"Mar 17, 2019",Material was presented fairly well for the most part.

436,Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments by University of Colorado System,Sara N H F,"Feb 24, 2024","First, I must say that this course was useful in the sense that I learned new concepts and processes, but I found several flaws. The instructor is not really engaging. The quizzes contained questions on issues never discussed in the course material (videos or readings), and some of them are ambiguous or have answers that can be different given the current state of the art, or are a matter of opinion more than a fact (for example, is SQL a difficult language to learn?); orientation to solve these themes-questions by individual work was not provided. Some parts of the course may be outdated. Also, files important to finish assignments (specifically, code for the module 5) are missing and could not be found. The final assignment is a peer-reviewed project, and one can see many posts in the forum, from peers waiting for their project to be evaluated; also, even though I agree that peer interaction and discussion is important, I think that review by an expert or instructor is essential to really get one's errors checked and corrected. I'm conscious that given the number of enrolled students and the open enrollment model, is nearly impossible to get all projects reviewed by an instructor, but I think that other final evaluation system should be considered.",2

479,Pattern Discovery in Data Mining by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Prashant K,"Mar 5, 2017","I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.
Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!) but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.

I have took over one month to figure it out, and the feedback system don't even provide me any help. The day that I have registered for this course, the coding is still new to me although I have got the training like 1 year thanks to Andrew Ng. And I could only used MATLAB/Octave or Python to solve the quiz. I have tried to use MATLAB to finished this course, but I failed many times. Finally, I have decided to use Python to solve this PA, and the algorithm is still hard for me to complete, so I used the python tool that with the algorithm in it and fix a little.
I believe that this course is a really good course, and Jiawei Han is a real kind person. BUT even for some other courses, we got a startup(like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course and Koller's PGM).
However, besides the PA, the rest of the course is really worth taking. I read the books for times and figured out that it indeed help! Though, it is hard for a new student.

557,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,Renan A d A,"Jun 8, 2022","I'm half way through it and I can say this is one of the best courses I have had in database and the foundation knowledge that you will acquire is very solid, the exams are also very tough which raise the bar of this program. The trainer looks very passionated about the topic which also helps keep you coming for more every day. Truly recommended if you are looking to transition to a data analytics role or if you want to re-assess or revisit the database management system topic. In my case it has been more than 10 yrs since I learned this in Uni.",5
558,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,Saad A K,"Jul 6, 2023","All the learning material was really well thought out. The lecturer or host, Glynn Durham was very easy to understand. I learned a lot despite having some knoeledge of SQL already. The only real nitpick I have is I wish normalization was covered in slightly more detail like what exactly entails each of 1NF, 2NF and 3NF; only 3NF as a whole was covered and not all points were discussed but the good thing is Glynn clearly pointed this out so it should be pretty easy for a beginner to fogure out that they might need to do their own research.",5
559,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,f v,"Aug 15, 2020",Very well constructed and presented course! Gives you all the basics of the techniques and technologies behind accessing and using Big Data using Impala and Hive. Good foundational course.  I had no previous knowledge of Big Data or any of its underlying information stores but got a solid understanding of it from this course. The hands on exercise is a good first step towards connecting to  Big Data sources from within a user friendly environment of Hue. Look forward to the rest of the courses. Great job from Cloudera!,5
560,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,Robby S,"Mar 23, 2021","The course gave a great overview of traditional relational database management systems and how they had endured for such a long time based on a number of robust considerations. However, with the rise of big data, it also examines and explains how traditional RDBMSs fail to cater to big data and the different types of data we see today. 
Overall, a great course to understand how traditional RDBMSs came about, their shortcomings with big data, and what are the possible solutions. 
Thanks!",5
561,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,kefei m,"Sep 19, 2020","The content is up-to-date and industry relevant. The syllabus is well designed, the lecturer is crystal clear. The presentations well produced and looks very professional. (Much better than the slides in UC San Diego's Big Data specialization course).
Tips: the quiz are a bit hard. You really need to care about the details in order to get the write answers. Plus, the scoring system doesn't give partial grades for 'choose all that apply'.
In summary, very good course. Highly recommend. ",5
562,Foundations for Big Data Analysis with SQL by Cloudera,Nandini B,"Jul 1, 2020","This course is very engaging and informative. Being a Data Analysis beginner, I could grasp the concepts  as the explanations were quite clear.

I recommend spending some extra time in the first week to download Matlab, because the online version expires your session after 1 hours and it also computes slower. (But this is a Matlab problem not a course problem)",5
675,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Yusrin R,"Aug 3, 2020","Thanks for the course. I would like to take the next course. I think Matlab is very powerful data processing software. By learning from the first and second courses, I have gotten a lot of new knowledge. I still want learn more about Matlab, so I will review all the courses (first and second courses). After the next course's ready, I will feel ready for its. If I have an oppurtunity, I would like to review and become mentor. Maybe mentor for my friend in my university (or this course if I'm worthy). ",5
676,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Krishna V D,"May 18, 2020","This Course was easy to grasp and very much beginner friendly, it picks up the pace ever so little over the first course while expanding the variety of knowledge imparted onto the students.

753,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Jason P,"Apr 1, 2021","I found this course significantly more difficult compared to the first course in the specialization.  I feel learning and education should be about sharing knowledge and experience. This course felt more like a game of hide and seek.  Quizzes and assignments required you to dig through the videos for one second mentions of functions or parameters.  Rather than finding the experience rewarding - more often I found it frustrating, as if Mathworks was trying to hide material and see if I could find it.  The videos are WAY to fast.  even when I reduced the playback speed to 0.75 I still had to start-stop often to keep up.  
In the end I'm glad I took the course and I learned some valuable skills.  However I felt this course was not as good as the first course (Exploratory Data Analysis).   Very little of what I learned in the first course prepared me for this one.",4
754,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,`Arif A b A P,"Aug 9, 2021","I've learnt a lot from this course and the material provided is really valuable and comprehensive. The videos are very well done and are not lengthy.

I'm actually a Python user and enrolled in this course for the content. I tried replicating the work in Python but not all of it could be done with ease so I still had to dabble in MATLAB for this course.

My only grouse is that the MATLAB license provided did not come with the 'text analytics toolbox' so I couldn't do the hands-on for these lessons.",4
755,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,卓玛多杰,"Aug 25, 2020","This course is very powerful that it introduce several toolbox in matlab. For me, to be honest, i think it requires an high-level matlab skill so that you can achieve the whole assignment with high grades.Although i have finished my course, i think i still need several times to review the course and be more familiar with the functions and toolboxs in matlab.
Anyway,it is challenging but i think it quite worth because matlab provides such powerful tool in so much fields.",4
756,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Madhuresh S,"Jul 15, 2020",The course was very intensive and practical. The trainers have explained all the concepts in precise manner so that in less time we could understand the maximum concepts.

757,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Dan W,"Aug 23, 2020","Lectures and course materials were helpful, though a lot of the content depends on toolboxes which are not generally available unless the user or the user's school/employer pays thousands of extra dollars.

758,Data Processing and Feature Engineering with MATLAB by MathWorks,Fabricio A B C,"Sep 25, 2020",The only problem is that some scripts are too long and there are statistical concepts that are not touched in deep but in general it's pretty good.

782,MongoDB Aggregation Framework by MongoDB Inc.,Andrew M,"Aug 23, 2018","The first two weeks are a good introduction to Aggregation and what you can do with it. The third week is more focused on using Mongo in machine learning applications and teaches you less new Mongo content and isn't in depth enough to be a good introduction to machine learning, but is a good way to get familiar with using the tools you've been shown earlier in the course. Some of the exercises are a little unclear in their wording but the course administrators are quick to reply in the forums and they update the workbooks in response to feedback. Overall would recommend to anyone who will be using Mongo and wants to get an overview of it's capabilities and some practise putting it into action.",4

One point I missed: there are no slides/pdf.

805,AWS: Data Collection Systems by Whizlabs,Will S,"Sep 6, 2023","This was my first time focusing on AWS services and at first it was a bit confusing, but the repetition of the services and their functions really helped me better understand how to use these AWS services. By the end you'll definitely have a greater sense of how to use the service, what tools are used to ingest based on the data sources, what pre-processing can be used before sending it to it's destination.
The material download was referenced a few times, but there was no download available anywhere.
This is a good course if you want to learn more about Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, Glue, Database Migration Services, Producer Libraries and Consumer Libraries.",4
806,Managing Big Data in Clusters and Cloud Storage by Cloudera,Fabiola S,"Jan 6, 2020","Coursera Team, 
This course has been the absolute best experience I have had with online learning. I've taken other courses on Coursera but this course is exemplary because of it structure, focus, and skilled instructors. 
Each course is well organized and stays on topic. However, if there are any related topics students should explore, the instructors have provided links for students to have a semi-guided self-taught journey on their own time. Other courses don't do that. 
The focused lessons keep data neophytes like myself feel less overwhelmed by the information taught in the course. Modern Big Data Analysis using SQL is a very broad yet important topic. However, the instructors on this course really ameliorate that overwhelming feeling with clear and focused lectures. 
The instructors come across as not only subject matter experts but as seasoned teaching professionals. They can explain the concepts in the courses in a clear and succinct manner without oversimplifying. Other instructors on Coursera, while skilled in their field, don't have the teaching finesse as Ian and Glynn do. If more courses on Coursera were taught by Ian and Glynn and others like them, I would pursue even more studies with Coursera.  
I hope this feedback is heard. 
P.S. - please release the Advanced SQL Course, I'm eager to pursue that. 
Thank you, 
Fabiola",5

Warning: Anyone 
thinking of doing the Specialization, consider the Honours track with 
pinch of salt. For some twisted/lazy logic the final Speclalization 
certificate doesn't show the Honours banner. Might not be a big deal to 
some, but still a bit of a let down. Especially when you paid for the

The project also goes deeper in the use of Tableau, so you will learn something new, which was not covered in the course.
Also the structure of the final project assignment is very good, with a dashboard to be realized in Tableau, a guided white paper and a recorded PowerPoint presentation.
Finally, it is offered for free after you complete the previuos four courses.",5

However, if you haven't searched for jobs before it may be a useful starting point.  Otherwise, there's not much to help the advanced job seeker apart from the lab environment for SQL queries and Python EDA.  Some suggestions would be a more in-depth look at ATS programs, how they work, and how to write resumes to maximise your chances to pass their selection.",3

I am not the 'police' that should be expected to downgrade people who don't do the assignment. I don't want to be that person. I paid to learn and not to police unethical behavior.

This gets really confusing and means Quiz Q7 needs to be answered with the opposite of the correct answer.
Filter out means to remove all values that meet a criteria, filter on means to keep only those values that meet the criteria.
Filtering OUT evens from a series of numbers, your resluting dataset is the odd numbers. Filtering ON even numbers discards the odds and leaves you with the evens.
The lecturer uses filter out when he means filter on.

1543,Enjoyable Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam,Aedrian A,"Jul 3, 2021","This audit-only/no-certificate free course, which I expected to be a casual introduction to econometrics principles for laypeople, is not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. This is especially in the latter half of the material, where barrages of increasingly complicated equations are thrown at you at a quick pace. A way to get something from this course, particularly for non-economics or non-statistics majors like me, hopefully is slow down, pause and/or repeat the videos from time to time. The course assumes a lot that a student should have prior to entering the course such as knowledge of college-level mathematics and statistics. Nevertheless, the value of this course really lies in introducing the learners to the complexity of the field and the real-life necessity to understand such complexity. This course is highly recommended to prospective students of formal economics and/or econometrics courses or formal programs to help them gauge their baseline capacity to thrive in such offerings. I am looking forward to go back to the course materials from time to time should I take comprehensive courses on the field.",4

Before I started this course I looking for some interesting materials in this field.
I found this course ""Enjoyable Econometrics"" and thought ""Ok if it's for beginners - it would be nice to start with this one""
But... My expectation was wrong. It's too brief course... and I didn't find something enjoyable when I can't understand more than 80% of the materials.
Yes, probably it's fun for that kind of person who knows something before it... but for newbies, it's not fun.
Concepts of all materials - is a brief review and show you some formulas without explanation - they show you only the results.
I won't recommend this course for beginners.

The course provides a couple of interesting examples to make the material 'fun',  but it then proceeds to throw equations at you without explaining core concepts or developing any underlying intuition. The discussion prompts also feel like busy-work.
